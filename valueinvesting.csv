1,,ValueInvesting,"Hi guys...I have gotten into Value Investing for few months and I realize this is the thing for me and want to get better at it. Have been trying to learn it through books, Youtube videos, online articles, forums like this subreddit, etc. While all these have been really helpful, I feel some **shortcomings**:

1. There is so much great content but it's spread all over the Internet. It's easy to miss on some gems and more importantly it's hard to **learn things in a logical sequence**. For example, you would really want to learn something basic like Circle of Competence early on. But you stumble upon it later and by that time you already have taken investment decisions that you would not have done in the first place had you known it earlier.
2. **Discipline** \- I don't know about others but I often get 'gaps of multiple weeks' when I am not learning anything. If there can be a weekly learning schedule where you are in some way answerable to a group can really help in bringing discipline.
3. **Live discussions** in small/closed groups - It's great to have discussions right after you have learnt something (just like in classrooms). Different people take away different things from the same piece of content. So exchanging perspectives adds real value.

To solve this, I suggest we can create a group where interested people can join. Together we can create a roadmap of content in a logical sequence for learning about Value Investing. We would need some expert advice here. Also, people may be at different stages of their Value Investing learning journey...so we can have more than one track. 

For pieces of content, we can pick book summaries, curate Youtube videos, podcasts, etc. Every week we have a say 45 - 60 mins session (just not too long). 15-20 mins (or more) we consume content and then followed by a discussion on it. We can do it on Zoom or any other platform. We can discuss how to pick stocks, evaluate companies, other fundamentals, etc.

**Suggestions are welcome.**

As of yesterday close, it is trading at $23.73, which is $3.73 above its NAV of $20, therefore currently trading 18.65% above its NAV, which is &lt;strong&gt;equivalent to a SPAC with a NAV of $10 and trading at $11.86&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

16,,ValueInvesting,"A lot of new investors consistently use PE ratio as justification as to why a stock is undervalued so here's a write up about the problems with that.

## Background

The price-to-earnings ratio is the most widely used multiple in the world. Pricing is much more common than valuing. In the DCF (Dscounted Cash Flow) model you have to make assumptions about growth, cash flows and risk, in pricing it requires fewer assumptions and its the simplest form of this approach. 

## Comparing PE ratios across industries

The P/E Ratio is difficult to use when comparing companies across industries. This is because different industries are evolving and making money in different ways and can have different P/E ratios.

If we compute the P/E ratio for 15 other companies and the P/E ratio of your company is 10 and the ratio for this sector is 15, we say that stock is cheaper. We are assuming that the other companies are fairly priced in the industry and because of that your company is underpriced. We assume that all firms within a sector have similar growth rates, cash flow and risk, a strategy of picking the lowest P/E ratio stock in each sector will yield undervalued stocks. Cheap stocks are often cheap for a reason. Therefore, we are making implicit assumptions about the companies.

This is the most common approach of estimating the P/E ratio for a firm but there are problems with this approach. Firms in the same industry can have different risk, growth prospects and profit margins. So if the stock looks cheap, it deserves to be cheap.

## Investment Strategies that compare PE to the expected growth rate

Analysts sometimes compare PE ratios to the expected growth rate to identify:

* Firms with **PE ratios less than their expected growth rate** are viewed as undervalued;
* Firms with **PE ratios more than their expected growth rate** are viewed as overvalued.

Another note to take is that bullish analysts like to use **forward numbers (1)** because it makes the P/E ratio multiple look lower. Bearish analysts always like to use **trailing numbers (2)** because it makes their stocks overpriced. In its more general form, the P/E ratio to growth is used as a measure of [relative value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/relative-value.asp).

1. **Forward P/E** forecasts projected future earnings of a stock.
2. **Trailing P/E** measures the [earnings per share](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eps.asp) of a stock for the previous 12 months.

## Problems with comparing PE ratios to expected growth

The biggest problem with the P/E ratio is that it doesn’t take growth into account but it is affected by the growth. So it doesn’t tell you much about the company’s ability to grow revenues and earnings in the future.

There’s three variables that drives P/E ratio for a stable growth dividend paying company:

* First, payout ratio the % of earnings pay out as dividends;
* Second, cost of equity reflective of the risk of the stock;
* Third, expected growth rate.

You have to put in control for differences in growths and earnings, cost of equity and payout ratios. 

&gt;""In its simple form, there is **no basis** for believing that a firm is undervalued just because it has a PE ratio less than expected growth. This relationship may be consistent with a fairly valued or even an overvalued firm, if **interest rates are high**, or if a firm is high risk.""

Some of the best performing stocks have had very high P/E ratios, such as Google or Amazon.

## Comparing PE ratios across Emerging Markets

By looking at the diagram below, Russian stocks look incredibly cheap. What we are actually missing here is that we have to consider the different [ERPs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equityriskpremium.asp) between the countries and **different controlling risk factors**. Riskier countries will have low P/E ratios but we have to bring real difference variables such as country risk, growth (high growth economies should have higher P/E ratios) and interest rates (high interest rate, low P/E ratio).

## The Bottom Line

P/E ratio should not be used to determine whether a stock is worth buying. However, there is no single metric that can predict whether a stock is a good or bad investment but relative valuation should be used in conjunction with other tools such as a [Discounted Cash Flow](https://tracktak.com/) which takes its key factors in terms of cash flows, growth and risk and research about the company’s financial statements to get a good picture of a company’s value and performance.

22,,ValueInvesting,"Hi everyone, 

I've been practicing calculating cash flow and EBITDA multiple valuations. One of my favorite companies is Village Farms International ($VFF). They have recently acquired a lucrative cannabis venture and, combined with their efficient produce business, I believe they will become a meaningful force in the cannabis markets over the coming years. Combined with their attractive valuation of about 3x 2021 revenue, I've invested quite a lot in this company. 

From 2021 to 2023, their total revenue is projected to grow at an average of 33% annually. As most will likely know, valuations in the cannabis space can be lofty (Canopy growth, Sundial and Aurora cannabis all have insane valuations). For FY 2023, $VFF is expected to close the year with $81 million of EBITDA on a revenue of 420 million USD (hehe). While analyst estimates are not available for 2024 and 2025, I expect about $140M in EBITDA for 2025. While these expectations are rosy, I think they're perfectly reasonable considering the annual growth of the Canadian cannabis industry as a whole. 

I've discussed with a friend and personally think an EBITDA multiple of 20x is fair for a business growing at this pace. While I don't want to make this into a DD, they have quite a lot of cash on hand ($135M) and relatively low debt ($70M) along with valuable assets in the form of land, buildings, machinery and such (millions of sq ft in greenhouses). Thus, my valuation for 2025 comes in at around $2.8B, implying around 330% upside. 

I know a lot of metrics are missing here, but I'd be interested in hearing your thoughts. Attached you will find analyst consensus estimates from the S&amp;P platform ([https://i.imgur.com/YlWwwCt.png](https://i.imgur.com/YlWwwCt.png))

24,,ValueInvesting,"Hey guys, this weekend I spent a ton of time reading about CLF and the steelmaking process and watching a lot of videos on youtube.

  Below is my vision based on company presentations, previous earning calls, 10Ks, 10Qs, and so on.

&amp;nbsp;

**Recent History of $CLF**

  Up until 2018, CLF was an iron-ore miner and producer in the form of pellets that it then sold to integrated steelmakers such as ArcelorMittalUSA and AK Steel. In fact, AMU and AKS, alongside Algoma (Canadian Steelmaker), made up 95% of the total revenue of CLF.

Iron Ore is just the raw material used in the steel-making process, mainly in Blast Furnaces and BOS (Basic Oxygenation Steelmaking). The alternative to the high capital intensive BF/BOS is the Electric Arc Furnace process (EAF). This uses mainly scrap metal and other iron feed, such as HBI/Pig Iron/DRI. These furnaces require less capital upfront to run and have more variable costs attached to them (more to this later, variable ≠ low cost).

In 2019 CLF acquired AK Steel and in 2020 they acquired ArcelorMittal, thus fully converting themselves into a vertically integrated steel producer.

These acquisitions position CLF as the largest flat steel producer in the US, ahead of Nucor and US Steel.
Annual production is roughly 17 million tons.

&amp;nbsp;

**CLF in 2021**

  With these recent acquisitions, CLF positions itself as a key and major player in the US Steel Industry.
The steel product mix breakdown is 28% hot-rolled steel (HRC), 18% cold-rolled, 33% coated, and 21% in others.

The customer base is 33% auto manufacturers, 25% infrastructure and manufacturing, 32% distributors &amp; converters, and 11% others.

CLF iron ore pellets will be mainly used for intracompany operations so the steel-making operations will not be impacted by the volatility of these prices.

CLF is on a great foot to achieve a record year in 2021 with a $5b projected EBITDA, almost twice as the last 5 years combined.

&amp;nbsp;

**Strategic Vision and Advantages**

  **I)** The auto industry is a key player and customer for CLF. During late 2020 and 2021 automakers haven’t been able to keep up with demand in new cars and their inventories have fallen to ~20 days, roughly half of what it was a year ago.

So there’s a lot of backlog demand in automakers, and thus a firm demand for CLF steel products.
The steel used in automaking is mainly AHSS (advanced high-strength steel) which CLF produces and is a high value-added item along with coated still (galvanized, galvalume, etc)

  **II)** During 2021 we have seen an unprecedented rise in steel prices. HRC prices are above $1,600 and started the year at around $1,000. Although CLF has fixed-price contracts with some customers, some naturally are expiring during the year and renovated at higher prices.

2021 Q1 EBITDA was $0.5 and projected Q2 is $1.4b. Full-year projections are $5b, which are totally feasible given the rise in steel prices and backlog for auto production.

Cashflow after CAPEX generated in Q1 was $0.3b (excluding increases in working capital). If cash flow generated during the rest of the year follows the EBITDA trend we can estimate it’s going to be in the $2.5-$3.0b range.
As the CEO has commented before, this cash would be used primarily to pay the debt accumulated by the company ($5.7b in Q1) that has an average weighted cost of 5,44% per year ($0.3b in annual interest).

  **III)** During the last 20 years US Steel production has migrated from BOS to EAF production. EAF mainly uses scrap metal as feed and depends on its quality and prices for steel production. Its advantages are that the initial capital costs are a fraction (less than 1/3) of what a BOS facility costs. 

As quality scrap becomes scarcer, EAF will need to supplement their feed with other iron products such as HBI.
In 2021 an HBI plant started production in the Great Lakes area producing around 2 million tons per year in order to feed CLF’s own EAFs and also third parties.  

As we stated previously, EAFs enjoy low capital costs and are driven mainly by their variable costs of energy + scrap metal. But scrap metal prices and volatile.

CLF mainly has BOS operations that benefit from their integrated pellet iron ore production, but also are investing in strategic HBI production so they can sell to this market as well.

  **IV)** US-made steel has the lowest carbon footprint of any steel-making country in the world. It produces almost half the emissions in countries such as Germany and Japan. China is the biggest pollutant country in this respect.
As such, US steel is very well positioned to embrace the climate change challenges and promote itself as green steel.
Also, CLF is trying to migrate to more natural gas use instead of coke (coal-based fuel) for its blast furnace operations.

&amp;nbsp;

**Risks**
  The main risks are the pricing of steel products as revenue is sensitive to them, and also demand, mainly by the auto industry. I believe the demand risk is low because auto-making in the US has been diminishing for some years but it’s not going to zero. Also, we’re seeing an increase in EV automakers manufacturing in the US, so that could be a plus.

  Climate and environmental regulations are also a risk, but I believe that US steel and CLF are very well positioned to take them on.

  Competition from other countries is a risk.

Raises in interest rates are also a risk because this is a capital-intensive business. According to the FED, there’ll be some hikes in 2023-2024 but they appear to be moderate and if CFL takes steps to pay part of their debt, this risk will be minor.

&amp;nbsp;

  **Valuation**

I'm not a big fan of DCF valuations, so I just do them to get a ballpark price or the assumptions that need to be met to achieve a certain share price.

  Assuming this year will be an extraordinary one with $2b in FCF, I’ll assume a range of between $0.5b and $1b as FCF for years to come (post interest expenses). This assumes a yearly CAPEX of $0.5b as well. The EBITDA pre acquisitions were around ~$350 million on average so $0.5b seems like a really low bound.
  According to several sites, the WACC seems to be in the 9% to 12% range, so I’m going to use the upper bound for a margin of safety.
Using a 2% perpetual growth rate (akin to GNP growth) I get a value between ~$23 and ~$45.

&amp;nbsp;

I've started to invest during the last year and read a lot about Warren Buffet on how he invests and analyze companies. Basically, when he looks at a figure, whether it's net income or FCF, it's pretty rare that he takes the numbers for what it is. 

Per example, to find out the real ""Net Income"" of a company, he says that he substract from the ""Net Income"" the recurrent capital expenditures.

When looking at ""Return on Equity"" , what number do you use? Net Income or FCF? Personally, I believe using FCF/Equity would be represent better the ""Return on Equity"" of a company and a better judge of the results of a company.

**Background**

The a2 Milk Company (A2M) was founded in New Zealand in 2000 on the knowledge that some people, having a certain level of lactose intolerance, who consume conventional cows’ milk, which contains a mixture between the A1 and A2 beta-casein protein, may experience digestive issues when drinking milk containing the A1 beta-casein protein. To solve this problem, A2M has supplied these consumers, with a premium milk product, only including the A2 beta-casein protein, since some of these consumers may experience health benefits, the Company reports.

The Company’s revenues primarily consist of its infant formula products (78% of total revenue in 1H21), while its liquid milk products are a smaller, but still significant part of the business (18% of total revenue in 1H21). The products are mainly being sold in New Zealand and Australia (ANZ) and China. Included in the ANZ market, is the daigou channel — which is comprised of Chinese merchants, primarily in Australia, who purchase the Company’s English-label products for consumers in China. These resellers have driven higher growth in the ANZ segment and the cross-border e-commerce (CBEC) segment of the business. Thus, the market in China is strategically important for the growth of the business. In China, the Company’s China-label infant formula products can be bought through mother and baby stores, modern supermarkets, and domestic e-commerce retail channels. English label products can be bought through ANZ retailers, ANZ-sourced resellers, and CBEC channels. 

A2M has been a phenomenal business seeing its revenues rise from NZ$0.352,5B in FY16 to NZ$1.732,5B in FY20, representing a CAGR of 48.9%. During the same period, the Company has seen a normalized net income CAGR of 88.9% and a free cash flow (FCF) CAGR of 113.4%, seeing most of the growth from consumers in China, as previously mentioned. Meanwhile, the Company had a return on equity between 30 to 50%, while being debt-free. Since the stock price peak in August 2020, the stock has tumbled from about NZ$22 a share to the bottom in May 2021 at about NZ$5.5 a share, which represents a decline of around 75%.

**What has caused the decline?**

Although the Company had this stellar performance, it has experienced some headwinds, which have been reflected in the stock price.

COVID-19 had a positive impact on the Company’s business at the start of the pandemic‚ when people were hoarding supplies at supermarkets, leading to further increased growth in the business in FY20. Since then, the Company has been adversely affected by the ongoing lockdowns in Australia, which has been extended and scheduled to end June 10th. Because of the lockdown, when international travel to and from Australia became restricted, the daigou resellers haven’t been able to buy products on behalf of Chinese consumers — which has been a problem for A2M, since the daigou channel constitutes a large portion of the Company’s revenues. Since the daigou channel is hard to track, the management has issued multiple revised outlooks for FY21, leading to share price decreases, because investors became concerned that the daigou channel wouldn’t return. Investors have become concerned, partly because the Chinese government has targeted the daigou channel, introducing stricter custom controls and regulating the gray market. Furthermore, the Australia-China relationship has put a damper to the prospect of future growth through the daigou channel since the relationship between the two countries began deteriorating in 2018 when a growing concern of political influence in various sectors of Australian society arose.

**Competitive advantage**

As previously mentioned, the Company sells its dairy products only including the A2 beta-casein protein, since some studies have shown, that people who experience digestive issues when consuming the A1 beta-casein protein might experience health benefits, when consuming dairy that only includes the A2 beta-casein protein. Although further studies have found a relation, which indicates health benefits for people with a certain level of dairy intolerance, a large body of evidence for the relation doesn’t exist, making the reported health benefits largely unknown. Nevertheless, the consumers *perceived* health benefits do provide a competitive advantage for A2M since the consumers don’t necessarily purchase products based on proven scientific evidence, as with e.g., organic products, but perhaps instead based on past experiences or recommendations, which is more evident with the products of A2M, given the high customer satisfaction, which can be observed at the reviews of the Company’s products.

A2M was the first business to offer dairy products only including the A2 beta-casein protein and has branded itself as a premium alternative to conventional milk products, claiming a price premium compared to normal milk.

In China, there’s a huge push to encourage the Chinese population to drink more milk, despite having 92.3% of Chinese adults suffering from a certain level of lactose intolerance and around 30% of Chinese children, since the consumption of milk in China is a means of combatting malnutrition, which has decreased due to governmental efforts and rising wealth in the country. Furthermore, the consumption of milk in China serves a political purpose, symbolizing a thriving society able to feed its population and having the population afford Western food. China has tried to meet its demand by increasing its domestic production through subsidies and regulation but hasn’t been able to produce enough, having demand consistently surpassing its domestic supply. China is, therefore, the largest importer of milk and will continue to depend on importing milk for the foreseeable future, because the cost of production in China is significantly higher, with a kilo of milk solids costing 43% more than its largest import partner New Zealand, the origin country of A2M. This provides a competitive advantage for dairy companies as A2M, driving growth for the foreseeable future.

In 2008, a Chinese milk scandal emerged, involving Chinese milk producers adding melamine to infant formula products to increase the protein content to pass quality control testing. This resulted in a total of 300,000 victims and several deaths, leading to a loss of consumer confidence in Chinese milk producers in China, continuing until today, where over 50% of Chinese consumers preferring foreign brands for baby formula. 

The infant formula market in China is driven by two opposing trends; China’s slowing birth rate and its growing income, making the population increasingly able to purchase more expensive products. China has grown fourfold since 2012 and makes up around 25% of the world’s demand for dairy, and it’s estimated to overtake the United States as the world's largest dairy market by 2022.

The growth prospect of the Chinese segment of the business, including the fact that most of the Chinese population suffer from a certain level of lactose intolerance and have low consumer confidence for its domestic producers, provides a competitive advantage for A2M, making it able to reap the benefits of the growing Chinese milk market. 

**Management**

The newly instated CEO of A2M is David Bortolussi, assuming the role at the start of 2021. Bortolussi has experience with growing brands and turning around companies in trouble, making him the perfect fit to become the CEO of A2M. The management has driven the Company forward, achieving high rates of growth in the business. They seem honest and trustworthy when answering questions on their conference calls, making the listeners understand the Company better. The management is currently expecting the daigou channel to resume when the uncertainty of the pandemic is over.

It’s possible to argue, that the severity of the decline in the stock price partly was due to the management’s poor communication to shareholders, sending a total of four revised outlooks for FY21, leading to a decreased trustworthiness among investors. Contrary, to the defense of the management, the daigou channel is hard to anticipate, being a gray market. Nevertheless, the management was able to sell a large portion of their stock right before the downturn, while still outwardly expecting further increased growth for FY21, reflecting on the ethics and honesty of the management. 

**Valuation**

Since we’re interested in holding the business over the long haul, including the fact that it’s hard to predict the Company’s short-term FCF, given the uncertainty surrounding the lockdowns in Australia, which has put a damper on the daigou channel, the post-pandemic value of the Company will first be calculated, using a discounted cash flow (DCF) method over the next 10 years with conservative assumptions, to minimize the likelihood of overestimating the value.

As previously mentioned, the pandemic first had a positive impact on the business, when people were hoarding supplies at supermarkets, making the Company a total of NZ$0.420,2B in FCF in FY20 up from NZ$0.285,7B in FY19, defined as operating cash flow minus capital expenditures. Since a part of the FCF in FY20 is artificially up due to the positive impact at the start of the pandemic, a more conservative estimate for the starting year of FCF is the average FCF in FY19 and FY20, being around NZ$0.350,0B, making the FCF yield to the current market cap of NZ$4.832,2B around 7.2%.

Since the analysts expect a growth rate of around 24% for the next 5 years, a growth rate of 20% for the first 5 years of the model will be used, due to conservatism. Furthermore, the growth rate of 15% for the last 5 years of the model is chosen, since the growth in the business will likely taper off when the Company becomes larger. As an estimate of the terminal value of A2M, a multiple of FCF of 15 is chosen, due to the high quality and growth rate of the business. The Company’s latest report for 1H21 shows that A2M has NZ$0.774,6B in cash at hand and NZ$0.017,5 in debt, making the post-pandemic present value for the entire Company — using a discount rate of 10% — NZ$16.272,3, representing a discount of the current market cap to the intrinsic value of 70.3%. The intrinsic value per share is therefore NZ$21.91, making it on par with the stock price before the crash. 

Instead of calculating the intrinsic value of the business, a DCF method can be utilized, to calculate the growth rate in which the market expects from the Company, given the current market cap. Assuming the same starting year of FCF of NZ$0.350,0B, multiple of FCF for the terminal value of 15, a discount rate of 10%, and same cash and debt as currently in the business, a growth rate of around -0.5% for the next 10 years is priced into the Company. If it, therefore, is assessed, that A2M can grow faster than -0.5% a year for 10 years, the Company is trading at a bargain price. 

The calculated intrinsic value of NZ$16.272,3, assumes the daigou channel to recover when the pandemic is over. As a thought experiment, it’s possible to solely value the China-label part of the business, which has been largely unaffected during the pandemic since the products are imported directly from New Zealand and increasing by 101.2% in FY20 on the prior corresponding period. Since the China-label component as of 2H20 represents 25% of the total revenues (currently 40%, having the ANZ segment decreased) and continually improving, the FCF for the China-label business can be estimated to NZ$0.087,5 (25%\*NZ$0.350,0). Assuming the same multiple of FCF for the terminal value of 15, discount rate of 10% and same cash and debt as currently in the business, a growth rate of around 18.5% per annum is needed for the next 10 years, to make the intrinsic value of the business equal to the present market cap. If it’s possible to achieve this growth in China, which it currently succeeds immensely, the ANZ, rising North American segment, and other Asian components of the business, are given for free. 

The opportunity of investing in A2M presents an asymmetrical risk to reward, which makes the investment more appealing. Given that the growth stabilizes to pre-pandemic levels, once the uncertainty of the pandemic relating to the business is over, the risk of opportunity cost arises since the intrinsic value is calculated on a post-pandemic basis, perhaps making it possible to put capital more effectively into use in the meantime. Over the long-term, it could be possible for the Company to diversify its product line into other dairy products, making the calculated present value of the business an even greater bargain. Since the management hasn’t bought stock in the Company, despite expecting growth in daigou channel to resume, while knowing the prospects of the business, increases the risk of investing in the business.

Since the daigou channel is hard to track, the management has issued multiple revised outlooks for FY21, leading to share price decreases, because investors became concerned that the daigou channel wouldn’t return. Investors have become concerned, partly because the Chinese government has targeted the daigou channel, introducing stricter custom controls and regulating the gray market. Furthermore, the Australia-China relationship has put a damper to the prospect of future growth through the daigou channel since the relationship between the two countries began deteriorating in 2018 when a growing concern of political influence in various sectors of Australian society arose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Competitive advantage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As previously mentioned, the Company sells its dairy products only including the A2 beta-casein protein, since some studies have shown, that people who experience digestive issues when consuming the A1 beta-casein protein might experience health benefits, when consuming dairy that only includes the A2 beta-casein protein. Although further studies have found a relation, which indicates health benefits for people with a certain level of dairy intolerance, a large body of evidence for the relation doesn’t exist, making the reported health benefits largely unknown. Nevertheless, the consumers &lt;em&gt;perceived&lt;/em&gt; health benefits do provide a competitive advantage for A2M since the consumers don’t necessarily purchase products based on proven scientific evidence, as with e.g., organic products, but perhaps instead based on past experiences or recommendations, which is more evident with the products of A2M, given the high customer satisfaction, which can be observed at the reviews of the Company’s products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A2M was the first business to offer dairy products only including the A2 beta-casein protein and has branded itself as a premium alternative to conventional milk products, claiming a price premium compared to normal milk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In China, there’s a huge push to encourage the Chinese population to drink more milk, despite having 92.3% of Chinese adults suffering from a certain level of lactose intolerance and around 30% of Chinese children, since the consumption of milk in China is a means of combatting malnutrition, which has decreased due to governmental efforts and rising wealth in the country. Furthermore, the consumption of milk in China serves a political purpose, symbolizing a thriving society able to feed its population and having the population afford Western food. China has tried to meet its demand by increasing its domestic production through subsidies and regulation but hasn’t been able to produce enough, having demand consistently surpassing its domestic supply. China is, therefore, the largest importer of milk and will continue to depend on importing milk for the foreseeable future, because the cost of production in China is significantly higher, with a kilo of milk solids costing 43% more than its largest import partner New Zealand, the origin country of A2M. This provides a competitive advantage for dairy companies as A2M, driving growth for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2008, a Chinese milk scandal emerged, involving Chinese milk producers adding melamine to infant formula products to increase the protein content to pass quality control testing. This resulted in a total of 300,000 victims and several deaths, leading to a loss of consumer confidence in Chinese milk producers in China, continuing until today, where over 50% of Chinese consumers preferring foreign brands for baby formula. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The infant formula market in China is driven by two opposing trends; China’s slowing birth rate and its growing income, making the population increasingly able to purchase more expensive products. China has grown fourfold since 2012 and makes up around 25% of the world’s demand for dairy, and it’s estimated to overtake the United States as the world&amp;#39;s largest dairy market by 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The growth prospect of the Chinese segment of the business, including the fact that most of the Chinese population suffer from a certain level of lactose intolerance and have low consumer confidence for its domestic producers, provides a competitive advantage for A2M, making it able to reap the benefits of the growing Chinese milk market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Management&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The newly instated CEO of A2M is David Bortolussi, assuming the role at the start of 2021. Bortolussi has experience with growing brands and turning around companies in trouble, making him the perfect fit to become the CEO of A2M. The management has driven the Company forward, achieving high rates of growth in the business. They seem honest and trustworthy when answering questions on their conference calls, making the listeners understand the Company better. The management is currently expecting the daigou channel to resume when the uncertainty of the pandemic is over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s possible to argue, that the severity of the decline in the stock price partly was due to the management’s poor communication to shareholders, sending a total of four revised outlooks for FY21, leading to a decreased trustworthiness among investors. Contrary, to the defense of the management, the daigou channel is hard to anticipate, being a gray market. Nevertheless, the management was able to sell a large portion of their stock right before the downturn, while still outwardly expecting further increased growth for FY21, reflecting on the ethics and honesty of the management. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Valuation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we’re interested in holding the business over the long haul, including the fact that it’s hard to predict the Company’s short-term FCF, given the uncertainty surrounding the lockdowns in Australia, which has put a damper on the daigou channel, the post-pandemic value of the Company will first be calculated, using a discounted cash flow (DCF) method over the next 10 years with conservative assumptions, to minimize the likelihood of overestimating the value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As previously mentioned, the pandemic first had a positive impact on the business, when people were hoarding supplies at supermarkets, making the Company a total of NZ$0.420,2B in FCF in FY20 up from NZ$0.285,7B in FY19, defined as operating cash flow minus capital expenditures. Since a part of the FCF in FY20 is artificially up due to the positive impact at the start of the pandemic, a more conservative estimate for the starting year of FCF is the average FCF in FY19 and FY20, being around NZ$0.350,0B, making the FCF yield to the current market cap of NZ$4.832,2B around 7.2%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the analysts expect a growth rate of around 24% for the next 5 years, a growth rate of 20% for the first 5 years of the model will be used, due to conservatism. Furthermore, the growth rate of 15% for the last 5 years of the model is chosen, since the growth in the business will likely taper off when the Company becomes larger. As an estimate of the terminal value of A2M, a multiple of FCF of 15 is chosen, due to the high quality and growth rate of the business. The Company’s latest report for 1H21 shows that A2M has NZ$0.774,6B in cash at hand and NZ$0.017,5 in debt, making the post-pandemic present value for the entire Company — using a discount rate of 10% — NZ$16.272,3, representing a discount of the current market cap to the intrinsic value of 70.3%. The intrinsic value per share is therefore NZ$21.91, making it on par with the stock price before the crash. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of calculating the intrinsic value of the business, a DCF method can be utilized, to calculate the growth rate in which the market expects from the Company, given the current market cap. Assuming the same starting year of FCF of NZ$0.350,0B, multiple of FCF for the terminal value of 15, a discount rate of 10%, and same cash and debt as currently in the business, a growth rate of around -0.5% for the next 10 years is priced into the Company. If it, therefore, is assessed, that A2M can grow faster than -0.5% a year for 10 years, the Company is trading at a bargain price. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The calculated intrinsic value of NZ$16.272,3, assumes the daigou channel to recover when the pandemic is over. As a thought experiment, it’s possible to solely value the China-label part of the business, which has been largely unaffected during the pandemic since the products are imported directly from New Zealand and increasing by 101.2% in FY20 on the prior corresponding period. Since the China-label component as of 2H20 represents 25% of the total revenues (currently 40%, having the ANZ segment decreased) and continually improving, the FCF for the China-label business can be estimated to NZ$0.087,5 (25%*NZ$0.350,0). Assuming the same multiple of FCF for the terminal value of 15, discount rate of 10% and same cash and debt as currently in the business, a growth rate of around 18.5% per annum is needed for the next 10 years, to make the intrinsic value of the business equal to the present market cap. If it’s possible to achieve this growth in China, which it currently succeeds immensely, the ANZ, rising North American segment, and other Asian components of the business, are given for free. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opportunity of investing in A2M presents an asymmetrical risk to reward, which makes the investment more appealing. Given that the growth stabilizes to pre-pandemic levels, once the uncertainty of the pandemic relating to the business is over, the risk of opportunity cost arises since the intrinsic value is calculated on a post-pandemic basis, perhaps making it possible to put capital more effectively into use in the meantime. Over the long-term, it could be possible for the Company to diversify its product line into other dairy products, making the calculated present value of the business an even greater bargain. Since the management hasn’t bought stock in the Company, despite expecting growth in daigou channel to resume, while knowing the prospects of the business, increases the risk of investing in the business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Catalyst&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Hey guys, newbie to value investing. After a few weeks of looking, I found a stock I feel has potential. The revenue in the past 5 years has been steadily increasing with 2020 leading to an x2 increase in revenue.

My question to you is, how would you handle a situation in which some of your stocks has already returned your expected annualized return for the next 10 years? The answer seems pretty obvious but I wanted to know what are your thoughts with this regard.

48,,ValueInvesting,"Just added $TUP Tupperware to my watchlist this morning. 

It’s current price of $20 is well below its 50 day avg ($25) and 200 day avg ($29). It’s been its lowest in 6mths and could be due for a reversal.

The P/E is low in comparison to the market and PEG is also less than 1 (0.75).

&lt;p&gt;Below a link to a 15-minutes video where I explain my approach and go through all the details. This is my 4th casual valuation after iRobot, Coca Cola and Target.&lt;/p&gt;

58,,ValueInvesting,"Restoration Hardware (RH) is a luxury furniture retailer. Think of it like an extremely expensive IKEA store. Since the pandemic lows last year the stock has seen an 850% increase in price, from lows of \~$80 to now trading at $650 and highs of $730.

This is a stock that Warren Buffet owns, and has recently bought more of at a reported price of $596 in their last filing. [https://dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=BRK](https://dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=BRK). If someone else can include their insights and explain why this stock is a good investment at these current levels, I would greatly appreciate it. However, I just haven't been able to understand why, as I believe there are more downsides to this stock making it extremely overvalued.

So why would Warren Buffet buy more of this stock?

1. Strong competitive MOAT, Buffet likes buying luxury names in which the company can raise the prices and people will still buy the product and service.
2. Return on Equity is extremely high (110%) albeit fueled by high levels of debt. Operating margins of 20%, Return on Capital Employed is 27.75% in 2020 (a massive increase from 11% in 2019)  and a steadily increasing operating revenue.
3. With low-interest rates, wealthy people are buying more houses and RH fills their need to furnish their homes.

Negatives:

1. RH is extremely overvalued. With a DCF valuation, the price of the stock should be around $290. While it is currently trading at $650. High valuations including P/FCF of 25.25, EV/EBITDA of 24.25, P/E of 47.18,P/B of 23.09, Debt to equity of 1.89
2. Here's a kicker, since RH's massive rally (increasing it's share price over 850%), the cost of goods sold has remained FLAT since 2019. In 2019 the cost of goods was 1,520,076 while in 2021 the cost of goods sold was 1,523,095. If the company was growing at such a pace to justify this massive price influx, we should also see consumer spending in their cost of goods sold increase as well. Not only that but there were no new stores opened since 2019.
3. Many of you probably haven't even heard of RH before, and google trends don't lie. Restoration Hardware has been slowly declining in google search results for the past 2 years. They own multiple websites rh.com , [rhmodern.com](https://rhmodern.com), [rhbabyandchild.com](https://rhbabyandchild.com), [rhteen.com](https://rhteen.com) in which only [rh.com](https://rh.com) is searched while the rest are completely dead.
4. Shift in upper-class spending: It is also believed that RH saw an increase in sales during the Coronavirus because the upper class had nothing to spend their money on, and wanted to upgrade their living area while they were stuck at home, however, with the vaccine out and more people traveling, we should expect to see wealthier people spend less money on furniture and more into traveling and entertainment.
5. Lastly, rising interest rates will significantly hurt RH in the future. From their Annual filing, ""We have historically relied on the availability of debt financing as one primary source of capital in order to fund our operations, including borrowings under our revolving line of credit. We have all incurred indebtedness to finance other strategic initiatives.."" With the expectation of rising interest rates, the future growth of RH will be significantly dampened, and RH should have seen a drop in price similar to how tech stocks dropped due to fear of interest rates rising.  Not only that but if rising interest rates occur, it would affect the housing market, which would also affect RH. ""An increase in interest rates may dampen growth in the U.S housing market and may depress consumer optimism about the U.S housing market and home buying in the higher end housing market""

Now I'm probably wrong if Warren Buffet continues to increase his position even at these high prices, and if someone can correct me, I would appreciate it. But at this rate, I may just buy some puts on this stock.",t2_i9ff2,False,,0,False,Warren Buffet's Restoration Hardware (RH) investment Extremely Overvalued?,[],r/ValueInvesting,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_o39e2c,False,dark,0.9,,public,14,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Stock Analysis,False,14,,False,False,self,1624083240.0,,[],{},,True,,1624110890.0,text,6,,,text,self.ValueInvesting,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Restoration Hardware (RH) is a luxury furniture retailer.

Hi Everyone,

I have been creating a FREE website concerned with finance and investing topics: www.thefinanceroundtable.com

The aim is to deliver complex content in a straightforward way!

The main reason that I decided to create this is because I struggled to link individual concepts together and practically apply knowledge I gleaned from classic books like ‘The Intelligent Investor’. I’m also insanely passionate about the subject, which helps.

The website covers both ‘special’ topics such as high frequency trading and series articles concerning topics such as psychology and stock analysis. There is A LOT in the pipeline:

- I have asked professionals in my network to reflect on their experiences and share their knowledge
- Weekly market updates coming
- Deep dives into value investing and other styles
- Book reviews
- Perhaps weekly or monthly stock picks

If you believe that you are knowledgeable and write well, there is also the potential to become a contributor.


I would love your feedback and support:

I am looking to value a small, growth-type business using a GARP approach. First, I aim to determine if the growth priced into the stock is reasonable.

Has anyone done this before? And if so, would you be willing to share your model? I am curious to see if there is a method or something that I am missing. I'd be happy to share my analysis with the subreddit once my work is complete. :)

64,,ValueInvesting,"$ATER (Aterian, formerly known as Mohawk) core business model is predicated on using large amounts of data and an agile supply chain to efficiently launch and manage consumer products on marketplaces such as Amazon and Walmart (the two largest third-party ecommerce platforms in the US). $ATER is a tech-enabled CPG company (consumer packaged goods) using their proprietary AI software called AIMEE (AI marketplace ecommerce engine) in 3 different ways:

1. BUILD: use AIMEE to maximize growth of existing brands across different marketplaces as well as identify category opportunities then leverage their agile supply chain to create and launch new brands
2. ACQUIRE: use AIMEE to identify acqusition targets, then acquire other brands with strong product portfolio and marketplace track record at accretive multiples
3. PARTNER: generate revenues by allowing other ecommerce brands to use AIMEE as a SaaS product thus enabling them to better manage their supply chain, marketing channels, ad spend, inventory levels, etc.

There’s also a great opportunity for $ATER to expand their existing brands and acquired brands across multiple marketplaces including international expansion opportunities.

$ATER posted very strong Q1 numbers — revenues grew 88% YoY to $48.1 million. One of the most surprising numbers in the Q1 report was gross margins improved from 40.2% in 2020 Q1 to 54.1% in 2021 Q1. This is a massive increase in gross margins and goes to show how efficient the $ATER business model really is. They are so good at eliminating costs and increasing operating margins. There aren’t many CPG companies with gross margins in the mid 50s, this is quite an accomplishment for $ATER.

In December 2020 $ATER acquired SMASH which includes brands such as Mueller, Pursteam, Pohl and Schmitt, and Spiralizer. Now, if you look at the recent 8-K filing from last week it’s clear these brands were growing at 127.6% YoY with 66.4% gross margins at the time of acquisition. These metrics are both better than anyone was expecting to see.

In the recent acquisition of Squatty Potty (you may have seen them on Shark Tank) they are paying a total of approximately $28 million for $5 million of earnings however knowing that $ATER is so good at eliminating fixed costs, I believe $ATER can squeeze another $2 million of costs out of Squatty Potty thus increasing those earnings to $7 million. \[Full disclosure, I own a Squatty Potty and I am a fan. Think garden hose to fire hose! :)\]

To understand how their products are received by consumers, check out any of their products on Amazon, nothing less than 4.5 stars. Their Air Conditioner (hOmelabs brand) just became the Best Seller beating LG, Emerson and Fridgiaire.

**Valuation**

At today's share price, $ATER is trading at less than 1.5x Sales (yes, insane). Its competitor, Thrasio, rumored to be in talks with a SPAC is likely valued between 6x and 10x sales. Thrasio has exactly the same business model, but without the AI platform.

Seneca Foods is currently trading at a 450M Market Cap ($50.00 per share) with a P/E ratio of 3.6 (TTM EPS of $13.72). Despite the stock trading near an all time high, the P/E ratio and liabilities are at an all time low. Meanwhile their assets, revenue, gross profit margin, profit margin and tangible book value are at an all time high.

Seneca owns a total of 10,000 acres and over 10.1 million square feet of buildings in states such as New York, Oregon, Wisconsin, Kentucky, Idaho, Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota.

There has been 5 insider purchases in the last 2 years (unfortunately, none of which were significant), there have been no insider sales.

78,,ValueInvesting,"Personally I consider myself a growth investor, but I care about value metrics to invest with a margin of safety and avoid hype-traps. Here are some practical tools to assist when valuing companies before considering an investment.

**First, some definitions:**

Market Cap = # of shares * price of a share. The total value of a company.

Enterprise Value (EV) = market cap - cash on hand + debts. If you were to buy out the whole company this is what it would cost you. (May be more useful than market cap because it isn't distorted by debt levels.)

**Value investing** to me means thinking of a stock as ownership in an ongoing business (rather than just a ticker that moves up and down in price), valuing that business in terms of its future cash flows, and investing at a price where you have a margin of safety in case your estimated value of the business was inaccurate.

### Valuation Metrics:

Some of these are easily displayed on various financial sites; others may require you to look into a company's balance sheet and build a spreadsheet yourself to calculate them. I'm writing this up to provide some of the intuition behind the numbers.

- **Price/Earnings (P/E)**: everyone knows this one, including company managers, and there's strong motivation to ""game"" earnings through various tactics. Low P/E is the market expressing low expectations for future earnings growth. Buying low P/E stocks simply because they're ""cheap"" can drop you into value traps which are cheap for a good reason.

Typically Earnings will refer to past (trailing twelve months) earnings; you may instead want to consider future, projected Earnings. But sometimes projections are wrong.

- **Price/Sales Ratio (P/S)**: earnings are easy to manipulate but sales figures, less so. A low P/S ratio means a company sells a lot relative to its market cap; it's possible they're not making much money because their operating margins are poor. If you think a company has the ability to improve profit margins, low P/S may find you a good value. [See Ken Fisher's old book, Super Stocks, for a full case about why low P/S is a good screen].

- **Price/Book (P/B)**: book value is measure of a company's assets if added up by an accountant (often meaning original purchase price). Old Ben Graham ""net-nets"" would screen for book value to look for companies with more assets than enterprise value - worth more dead than alive - as ultimate margin of safety. However, those are basically never found these days, and with assets being increasingly brand names or other intangibles, book value is less meaningful. EXCEPTION: comparing bank stocks, where book is (basically) the amount of deposit assets the bank has to work with; P/B &gt; 2 for a bank is ""expensive"", P/B &lt; 1 for a bank is ""cheap"" (or means they're in deep shit). 

- **Acquirer's Multiple**: Enterprise Value/Operating Earnings. If you were to buy the company, how costly is it to acquire a dollar of operating earnings? (Lower is better; right now, &lt;10 is cheap). Popularized by Tobias Carlisle, you can easily use this screener at www.acquirersmultiple.com

- **Cash Flow Yield**: Free Cash Flow/Enterprise Value. (Look up elsewhere how to calculate FCF). FCF represents how much a company can potentially return to shareholders, either as dividends/buybacks or investment in future growth, after paying necessary expenses to keep running. As a personal screen, I want to see a FCF Yield equal to 20-year Treasury Yield plus some risk premium. Less than 2% FCF Yield is non-investible to me personally.

### Profitability Metrics

These are useful metrics to avoid stocks that are cheap because they're shitty businesses (value traps).

- **Return on Equity (ROE)**: how much profit is generated for each shareholder dollar. As a rule of thumb, earnings growth can never exceed ROE (although high ROE is no guarantee of growth). Will be higher for companies with a lot of debt on the balance sheet, something to be aware of when doing comparisons.

- **Return on Assets**: profit relative to book value. Higher is better. Multiply this by leverage to get ROE.

- **ROIC**: factors in both debt and equity for ability to generate profits (it's a bit complicated). Importantly, is meaningless when looking at financial stocks.

- Return on Capital Employed: Operating Earnings/(Assets - Current Liabilities). A screen I personally use as a rough-and-ready ROIC.

- **Magic Formula**: popularized by Joel Greenblatt ""Little Book that Beats the Market"". Idea being a company with a low valuation combined with high profitability. See www.magicformulainvesting.com

Just like there are value traps with P/E ratios, there can be ""efficiency traps"" with high ROICs; companies which dominate their niche and have good operations but are not growing. The best possible company will have high ROIC and also rapidly growing earnings, because they are applying efficient practices to a larger and larger market (these are rare to find at bargain prices). 

A cyclical company at the peak of its cycle may have great ROIC but will not sustain it; you can use gurufocus.com to look at the past few year's ROIC. Very high ROICs will invite competitors and decline over time; a long period of high ROIC probably indicates a competitive moat.

### Screens you can Use

I've collected various screens from books I've read, other experimentation, etc. Here they are for your consumption. If you get too many/few results, tinker with the numbers a little up or down. (It should go without saying, but a company showing up from a screener does not necessarily make it a good investment.)

*[For all screens I will typically begin with: Domestic Only, NYSE or NASDAQ exchange (no OTC), Market Cap &gt; 1 Billion.]*

- **Ghetto Magic Formula Screen**: No Real Estate or Utilities; ROIC Highest 20% of Industry; P/E lowest 20% of Industry.

- **Graham's Enterprising Screen**: Current Ratio &gt; 1.5; Price/Book &lt; 2; EPS Growth last 5 years &gt; 15%; Debt/Equity &lt; 1.

- **Motley Fool Screen**: Revenue Growth Last 5 Years &gt; 15%; EPS Growth most recent quarter vs. 1 year ago &gt; 10%; Net Profit Margin &gt; 15%; ROE &gt; 15%; Debt/Equity &lt; 0.5; Current Ratio &gt; 1.

- **Munger Screen**: EPS Growth Last 5 Years &gt; 10%; ROE &gt; 15%; Current Ratio &gt; 1.5; Debt/Equity &lt; 0.5; Price &gt; $9; P/E &lt; 21.

- **Lynch Screen**: PEG &lt; 1.2; EPS Growth last 5 years &gt; 18%; ROE &gt; 13%; Debt/Equity &lt; 0.6; Market Cap Micro, Small, or Mid.

- **Schloss Dividend Value Screen**: Dividend Yield &gt; 1.9%; Current Ratio &gt; 1.25; Price/Book &lt; 1; Debt/Equity &lt; 0.6; Net Profit Margin &gt; 0; Market Cap &gt; 5 Billion.

- **Fisher Super Stock Screen**: Price/Sales &lt; 1; Net Profit Margin &gt; 6%; Sector Excludes Energy and Real Estate.

- **Burry Value Screen**: ROE &gt; 18%; Price/Cash Flow &lt; 25; Current Ratio &gt; 2.75; ROIC 10%-27%; Debt/Equity &lt; 0.5; EPS Growth last 3 and 5 years &gt; 7%; Revenue Growth rate Last 5 years &gt; 4%; Percent held by institutions &lt; 90%.

- **Fundsmith Quality Screen**: ROIC highest 25% of Industry; Price/Cash Flow lowest 25% of industry; Sectors exclude Consumer Durables, Energy, Financials, Industrials, Materials, Pharmaceuticals, Real Estate, Utilities. (Includes: Communication Services, Consumer Staples, Information Technology, Health Care Providers and Devices).

*You can add a momentum element to any of these screens by including: Percentage below 52 week high &lt; 5%-10%.*

### Due Diligence (DD) Checklist

This is my ""to-do before a buy"" checklist, to eliminate companies found from one of the above screens:

1.	Earnings: Past 5 years growth of revenue, earnings, cash flow.

2.	Ratios: compare to nearest competitors. P/E, P/cash flow.

3. 	Cash Flow Yield &gt; Risk Free Rate + Risk Premium

4.	Charts: is P/E at a relative high, is there stable revenue growth to justify P/E's expectations?

5.	from Balance Sheet - EV/EBIT ratio, return on capital employed.

6.	Judge financial health relative to amount of leverage (current ratio, quick ratio).

7.	Visit company's investor relations website and read their most recent investor presentation.

8.	Most recent annual report 10K - Read description of business and risks.

9.	Search for Customer and Employee Reviews online.
 
10.	Look for ongoing issues or controversies with the company in the news.

EXCEPTION: comparing bank stocks, where book is (basically) the amount of deposit assets the bank has to work with; P/B &amp;gt; 2 for a bank is &amp;quot;expensive&amp;quot;, P/B &amp;lt; 1 for a bank is &amp;quot;cheap&amp;quot; (or means they&amp;#39;re in deep shit). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acquirer&amp;#39;s Multiple&lt;/strong&gt;: Enterprise Value/Operating Earnings. If you were to buy the company, how costly is it to acquire a dollar of operating earnings? (Lower is better; right now, &amp;lt;10 is cheap). Popularized by Tobias Carlisle, you can easily use this screener at &lt;a href=""http://www.acquirersmultiple.com""&gt;www.acquirersmultiple.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cash Flow Yield&lt;/strong&gt;: Free Cash Flow/Enterprise Value. (Look up elsewhere how to calculate FCF). FCF represents how much a company can potentially return to shareholders, either as dividends/buybacks or investment in future growth, after paying necessary expenses to keep running. As a personal screen, I want to see a FCF Yield equal to 20-year Treasury Yield plus some risk premium. Less than 2% FCF Yield is non-investible to me personally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Profitability Metrics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are useful metrics to avoid stocks that are cheap because they&amp;#39;re shitty businesses (value traps).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Return on Equity (ROE)&lt;/strong&gt;: how much profit is generated for each shareholder dollar. As a rule of thumb, earnings growth can never exceed ROE (although high ROE is no guarantee of growth). Will be higher for companies with a lot of debt on the balance sheet, something to be aware of when doing comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Return on Assets&lt;/strong&gt;: profit relative to book value. Higher is better. Multiply this by leverage to get ROE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ROIC&lt;/strong&gt;: factors in both debt and equity for ability to generate profits (it&amp;#39;s a bit complicated). Importantly, is meaningless when looking at financial stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Return on Capital Employed: Operating Earnings/(Assets - Current Liabilities). A screen I personally use as a rough-and-ready ROIC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magic Formula&lt;/strong&gt;: popularized by Joel Greenblatt &amp;quot;Little Book that Beats the Market&amp;quot;. Idea being a company with a low valuation combined with high profitability. See &lt;a href=""http://www.magicformulainvesting.com""&gt;www.magicformulainvesting.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like there are value traps with P/E ratios, there can be &amp;quot;efficiency traps&amp;quot; with high ROICs; companies which dominate their niche and have good operations but are not growing. The best possible company will have high ROIC and also rapidly growing earnings, because they are applying efficient practices to a larger and larger market (these are rare to find at bargain prices). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A cyclical company at the peak of its cycle may have great ROIC but will not sustain it; you can use gurufocus.com to look at the past few year&amp;#39;s ROIC. Very high ROICs will invite competitors and decline over time; a long period of high ROIC probably indicates a competitive moat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Screens you can Use&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve collected various screens from books I&amp;#39;ve read, other experimentation, etc. Here they are for your consumption. If you get too many/few results, tinker with the numbers a little up or down. (It should go without saying, but a company showing up from a screener does not necessarily make it a good investment.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[For all screens I will typically begin with: Domestic Only, NYSE or NASDAQ exchange (no OTC), Market Cap &amp;gt; 1 Billion.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ghetto Magic Formula Screen&lt;/strong&gt;: No Real Estate or Utilities; ROIC Highest 20% of Industry; P/E lowest 20% of Industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Graham&amp;#39;s Enterprising Screen&lt;/strong&gt;: Current Ratio &amp;gt; 1.5; Price/Book &amp;lt; 2; EPS Growth last 5 years &amp;gt; 15%; Debt/Equity &amp;lt; 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Motley Fool Screen&lt;/strong&gt;: Revenue Growth Last 5 Years &amp;gt; 15%; EPS Growth most recent quarter vs. 1 year ago &amp;gt; 10%; Net Profit Margin &amp;gt; 15%; ROE &amp;gt; 15%; Debt/Equity &amp;lt; 0.5; Current Ratio &amp;gt; 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Munger Screen&lt;/strong&gt;: EPS Growth Last 5 Years &amp;gt; 10%; ROE &amp;gt; 15%; Current Ratio &amp;gt; 1.5; Debt/Equity &amp;lt; 0.5; Price &amp;gt; $9; P/E &amp;lt; 21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lynch Screen&lt;/strong&gt;: PEG &amp;lt; 1.2; EPS Growth last 5 years &amp;gt; 18%; ROE &amp;gt; 13%; Debt/Equity &amp;lt; 0.6; Market Cap Micro, Small, or Mid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Schloss Dividend Value Screen&lt;/strong&gt;: Dividend Yield &amp;gt; 1.9%; Current Ratio &amp;gt; 1.25; Price/Book &amp;lt; 1; Debt/Equity &amp;lt; 0.6; Net Profit Margin &amp;gt; 0; Market Cap &amp;gt; 5 Billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fisher Super Stock Screen&lt;/strong&gt;: Price/Sales &amp;lt; 1; Net Profit Margin &amp;gt; 6%; Sector Excludes Energy and Real Estate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Burry Value Screen&lt;/strong&gt;: ROE &amp;gt; 18%; Price/Cash Flow &amp;lt; 25; Current Ratio &amp;gt; 2.75; ROIC 10%-27%; Debt/Equity &amp;lt; 0.5; EPS Growth last 3 and 5 years &amp;gt; 7%; Revenue Growth rate Last 5 years &amp;gt; 4%; Percent held by institutions &amp;lt; 90%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fundsmith Quality Screen&lt;/strong&gt;: ROIC highest 25% of Industry; Price/Cash Flow lowest 25% of industry; Sectors exclude Consumer Durables, Energy, Financials, Industrials, Materials, Pharmaceuticals, Real Estate, Utilities. (Includes: Communication Services, Consumer Staples, Information Technology, Health Care Providers and Devices).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can add a momentum element to any of these screens by including: Percentage below 52 week high &amp;lt; 5%-10%.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Due Diligence (DD) Checklist&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my &amp;quot;to-do before a buy&amp;quot; checklist, to eliminate companies found from one of the above screens:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earnings: Past 5 years growth of revenue, earnings, cash flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ratios: compare to nearest competitors. P/E, P/cash flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cash Flow Yield &amp;gt; Risk Free Rate + Risk Premium&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charts: is P/E at a relative high, is there stable revenue growth to justify P/E&amp;#39;s expectations?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;from Balance Sheet - EV/EBIT ratio, return on capital employed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judge financial health relative to amount of leverage (current ratio, quick ratio).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visit company&amp;#39;s investor relations website and read their most recent investor presentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most recent annual report 10K - Read description of business and risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Search for Customer and Employee Reviews online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look for ongoing issues or controversies with the company in the news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope somebody finds this helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

83,,ValueInvesting,"Hello all - this is a genuine question...but I am expecting downvotes.

From Investopedia - Value investing is an investment strategy that involves picking stocks that appear to be trading for less than their intrinsic or book value. Value investors actively ferret out stocks they think the stock market is underestimating. They believe the market overreacts to good and bad news, resulting in stock price movements that do not correspond to a company's long-term fundamentals. The overreaction offers an opportunity to profit by buying stocks at discounted prices—on sale. 

So as an example, Halloween candy goes on sale right after Halloween.  So before Halloween the candy is trading at $4, but I believe it's really only worth $2.  So if all I care about is buying candy at a discount, I would wait for the price to drop after Halloween.  Doesn't that mean I am timing the market?

You may come up with an intrinsic value through fundamental analysis which drives your decision of whether to purchase a stock, but you still need to wait/time the market until that stock price reaches what you believe is a good trade.  

If you really like a company to the point where you will buy it at any price and hold for 10+ years (so not taking time or price into account at all), wouldn't this by definition not be value investing?",t2_zl2tubx,False,,0,False,Value investing and Timing the market - confused,[],r/ValueInvesting,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_o1yhxc,False,dark,0.92,,public,23,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Question / Help,False,23,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1623968685.0,text,6,,,text,self.ValueInvesting,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello all - this is a genuine question...but I am expecting downvotes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Investopedia - Value investing is an investment strategy that involves picking stocks that appear to be trading for less than their intrinsic or book value. Value investors actively ferret out stocks they think the stock market is underestimating. They believe the market overreacts to good and bad news, resulting in stock price movements that do not correspond to a company&amp;#39;s long-term fundamentals. The overreaction offers an opportunity to profit by buying stocks at discounted prices—on sale. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So as an example, Halloween candy goes on sale right after Halloween.  So before Halloween the candy is trading at $4, but I believe it&amp;#39;s really only worth $2.  So if all I care about is buying candy at a discount, I would wait for the price to drop after Halloween.  Doesn&amp;#39;t that mean I am timing the market?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may come up with an intrinsic value through fundamental analysis which drives your decision of whether to purchase a stock, but you still need to wait/time the market until that stock price reaches what you believe is a good trade.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you really like a company to the point where you will buy it at any price and hold for 10+ years (so not taking time or price into account at all), wouldn&amp;#39;t this by definition not be value investing?&lt;/p&gt;

85,,ValueInvesting,"When doing value investing stock picks, it seems the most discussed topic is about buying below intrinsic value with a decent margin of safety, as well as using other valuation methods and screeners. 

This is all important, but from what I’ve seen, particularly from Warren Buffett, is that Charlie Munger really honed in that defining attributes of quality business should play a large part in the stock picking process and gives an investor wiggle room if a stock isn’t at as much of a discount to intrinsic value as you would like to. For example, the Buffet quote that goes like “it’s better to buy a great business at a decent price, than a decent business at a great price”. 

With this being said, I’ve been making a list of a more psychological screener to do in addition to fundamental analysis.  Here are some below:

1. Consumers love the company specifically and enjoy spending money with them, especially compared to competitors, easy to spend money there, don’t overthink/feel guilty about buying things

2. Good Operating Margins and pricing power

3. Ideally Dividend Paying

4. Able to grow, add new products, not be affected by the economy/politics too much

5. Diversified and not being dependent on short term fads/debt

6. Good management, people like to work there, ideally less decision making required on part of management

From this, as well as looking at the BRK/B holdings, I think a few stocks really exemplify these ideas. 

-Apple (AAPL), American Express (AXP), Disney (DIS), Coca Cola (KO). 

Additionally, but to a slightly lesser extent, Kraft Heinz (KHC) and Costco (COST).

88,,ValueInvesting,"For those who don't know, PSTH is a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) created by legendary value investor Bill Ackman. Recently, Bill announced an amazing deal that I will explain below. For each share of PSTH, you buy you will get:

**1 share of Universal Music Group:**

This costs $14.75 per PSTH share. Bill bought 10% of UMG at a valuation of $42.4 billion. Goldman Sachs recently valued UMG at $53 Billion, and Bank of America just valued UMG at $59 Billion. If UMG trades near these new valuations, this $14.75 share will be worth \~$19-20.

**UMG has a Huge Moat/Significant Barriers to Entry**

Everybody loves music, and record labels are the leeches of the music industry. Unethical? Maybe. Good for PSTH investors? Absolutely. Take a look at the names of Universal Music Group artists (Drake, Kanye, Taylor Swift, Olivia Rodrigo, and the Beatles to name just a few. To reiterate, we own the fucking Beatles!) [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_Universal\_Music\_Group\_artists](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Universal_Music_Group_artists)

**1 share of PSTH**:

That's right, you get another company! Bill only used $4 Billion of the cash he had, leaving him with $1.5 Billion for RemainCo (the remaining company). $5.25 of each PSTH share will be allocated for this RemainCo.  It's almost impossible to speculate what company this will be, although r/PSTH thinks that it's Plaid or Impossible Foods, so it's almost certainly neither (jk love y'all). When will this company be announced? Once again, it's hard to say. Bill has known about this deal structure since November, giving him 7 months to find targets/negotiate deals. After 6/22 (date of vote by Vivendi shareholders to finalize the UMG deal) , Bill will be allowed to discuss ALL of this in more depth, and maybe even give us an announcement for RemainCo.

**1 SPAR:**

This is the icing on the cake. 1 SPAR gives you the right to purchase SPARC which is PSTH 2 at NAV ($20). Bill has $6-10.6 Billion to purchase \~10% of a huge company, and with SPARC you get access to the pre-IPO Price. You can only exercise these SPARs after SPARC enters a Definitive Agreement with a company. So unlike SPACs, with SPA**R**C, there is no opportunity cost. With SPAR, you have the opportunity to invest at NAV only after you know what the company is.

Not only that, but Bill also recently [tweeted](https://twitter.com/BillAckman/status/1401376625401470977) that PSTH shareholders will get access to ALL future SPARCS at NAV. Just imagine if he does like 5-10 SPARCs over the next decade. This could potentially be the most valuable part of this deal, but for now, I'll say 1 SPAR + Warrants is worth $5 because it's super hard to estimate.

**2/9 Warrants:**

I don't want to go too much into depth on this, but you get at least 2 warrants per 9 shares held through the merger. More info [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PSTH/wiki/index)

**So, what's PSTH's value?**

$20 (UMG)+ $5.25(RemainCo) +$5(SPAR+Warrants) = $30.25.

At the time of this post, PSTH is trading at around $22.50 which is significantly undervalued at the moment IMO.

“We bought See’s for $25 million when its sales were $30 million and pre-tax earnings were less than $5 million. The capital then required to conduct the business was $8 million. (Modest seasonal debt was also needed for a few months each year.) Consequently, the company was earning 60% pre-tax on invested capital. Two factors helped to minimize the funds required for operations. First, the product was sold for cash, and that eliminated accounts receivable.

“We bought See’s for $25 million when its sales were $30 million and pre-tax earnings were less than $5 million. The capital then required to conduct the business was $8 million. (Modest seasonal debt was also needed for a few months each year.) Consequently, the company was earning 60% pre-tax on invested capital. Two factors helped to minimize the funds required for operations. First, the product was sold for cash, and that eliminated accounts receivable. Second, the production and distribution cycle was short, which minimized inventories.

After acquiring company B,  company A would now have to penalise its EBIT by amortising these very intangibles it just created. The valuation of these acquired intangibles is also prone to a high degree of error and misjudgment, so the value you use for amortisation can be rather arbitrary and distort EBIT. Hence EBITA.

105,,ValueInvesting,"Here’s my case for $BARK. I am not a financial advisor, just a dog lover. I have two awesome dogs: a wheaten terrier, and a havashire.

I currently hold an approximate $1.2 million position in $BARK, in the form of common stock, warrants, covered calls, and puts that I have sold. I’ve averaged up 3 times, and have eaten every dip.

Here's a screenshot of my position, since I couldn't post any images. 

[https://ibb.co/LZXhfJs](https://ibb.co/LZXhfJs)

**Summary**

* Dog owners love their dogs.
* Before $BARK, there was no company that was able to deliver the full spectrum of products that dogs need **under one universally trusted** brand.
* Most dog brands exist in their individual silos, i.e. just food, just toys, just sticks, etc.

It started as a monthly dog toy subscription service. Since 2020, it has added new divisions in order to be the go-to brand for all products your dog will ever need.

* Barkbox has created a loyal base of 1.8 million subscribers,
* Low churn rate of 5.4% --- and has expanded into other products to maximize the value of this consumer relationship.
* Thanks to it’s recent IPO, the stock has a warchest of \~$427 million to further boost its growth.
* **Vertically integrated, they make their own stuff which is why gross margins are high**

My thesis is that Barkbox has created a noteworthy sticky brand - and will see substantial growth through it’s multi-pronged approach at monetizing it’s client base.

* Most recently, Barkbox was added to Amazon’s subscription boxes landing page. This is a new development. More info about this can be read [here](https://www.pymnts.com/subscription-commerce/2021/third-party-subscriptions-amazon/) and why it’s so important.
* With over 50% of the e-commerce market on Amazon, Barkbox’s new inclusion into Amazon subscription will boost it’s existing revenue.

**The Opportunity**

* $36.9 billion is estimated to be spent on food in 2020
* $19.2 billion is estimated to be spent on supplies/otc medicine
* $29.3 billion is estimated to be spent on vet care

[During covid, an estimated 11.38 million US households have gotten a new pet.](https://todaysveterinarybusiness.com/pets-appa-survey-covid/)

* Petcare market in the USA is more than $50 billion and will continue to grow.
* Pet industry is mostly dominated by brick and mortar retailers.
* The pet market is in the early stages of innovation and is brimming for something new.

According to[ PYMNTS.com](https://securecdn.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Subscription-Commerce-Conversion-Index-November-2020.pdf), ¾ of US adults - 182 million consumers, subscribed to at least 1 subscription service since last July. Nearly 50% of consumers who signed on for a new subscription since the pandemic began intend to stick with it even after the pandemic is over.

**Here is the overview on Barkbox**

**Barkbox** is the first **full spectrum** dog brand that is capitalizing on all aspects of the human relationship with his/her best friend.

* Fun
* Health
* Food
* Essentials

Barkbox has a product for every situation, and it has a loyal customer base.

**Product**

* Fun: Barkbox launched in 2012, with its signature monthly toys/treats box.
* Fun with Big Dogs: Barkbox launched its [*Bark Super Chewer*](https://www.barkbox.com/super-chewer) in 2017, a line of super durable toys.
* Essentials: Barkbox launched *Bark Home* in 2019, selling essentials (beds, leashes, collars).
* Health: Barkbox launched [*Bark Bright*](https://www.barkbox.com/brightdental) in 2020, selling dog dental solutions, and health/wellness goods.
* Food: Bark launched [*Bark Eats*](https://hello.barkeats.com/?utm_source=box_header) in 2020, personalized health food blends.

**Strong Economics**

* The average life time of a subscriber is 16.1 months
* The customer acquisition cost is “paid back” within 4 months
* Return on customer acquisition cost is over **350%** in 2 years
* Over the last several years, Barkbox has increased gross profit per subscription, while reducing customer acquisition costs.

**High Margin**

* Barkbox gross margin is \~60%
* In comparison, Chewy, a marketplace for pet products, is around \~25%

**Social Media**

* $BARK has 8.5 million social media followers, even though it specifically focuses on dogs.
* $CHWY in comparison has \~2.3 million on Facebook/Instagram combined, even though it focuses on all types of pets..not just dogs

**Growth Levers**

* Expanding into new product categories
* Growing subscriptions
* Cross-selling new products
* Growing retail, and e-commerce channels
* Cost efficiencies only possible with more scale
* Build “own” facilities to do warehouse and fulfillment, which will improve customer experience too

**The Team**

Former co-founder of Meetup, Matt Meeker, is Executive Chairman/Co-Founder.

Former Director of Amazon Global is CEO.

Members of the management team have been featured in Fast Company’s list of “Most Creative People,” and Forbes “30 under 30”, among other accolades.

**Omni-channel Distribution**

* Barkbox has built an impressive brand, and it collaborates with retail partners in addition to selling directly to consumers.
* It’s distributed by major retailers such as: Target, Amazon, [Costco](https://dogoday.com/2021/02/04/costco-barkbox-collection-is-back-and-its-super-cute/), Walmart, and Petsmart
* It does joint collaborations with brand such as [Bluestone Lane](https://bluestonelane.com/barkxbluestone/), and even [Anheuser-Bush](https://barkpost.com/life/bark-budweiser-7-pack/), among many others, such as the [NBA](https://www.barkbox.com/themes/NBA).

**Barkbox has over 1.8 million annual active subscribers.**

In an investment deck for the popular App Acorns, BarkBox was mentioned as having one of the biggest subscriber bases, alongside big brands such as: NYTimes, Dropbox, Peloton, and Spotify - due to its impressive subscriber base.

**Competition**

Barkbox has no true competitors. Most brands exist in their own individual silo, i.e. just food, or toys. Other competitors like Chewy, are marketplaces.

$HIMS is a consumer subscription based model, that seems to be a good peer for comparison purposes. Due $HIMS recurring subscription revenue model, it is a good comparison for discussions. Based on $HIMS valuation, this would support $BARK trading in the $15-20 area.

For general purposes, I have included a comparison of other pet related brands.

CHWY - Chewy

FRPT - Freshpet

TRUP - Trupanion

**Risks**

No DD is complete without thinking about the bear case.

Most recently, Chewy, a competitor of $BARK, reported profits but warned of labor shortages and supply disruptions.

Even though $BARK is vertically integrated, it is likely that it will have the same labor and supply disruptions, as all businesses are facing.

Shortly before it’s IPO, $BARK was accused of selling a chew stick that killed a pet. There is no evidence the chew stick was responsible.

* Instead of ignoring the allegation, Barkbox immediately addressed it via social media, and said it was working with the manufacturer to look into the death.
* Barkbox immediately stopped distributing the item.
* Their emphasis on “doing the right thing,” speaks loudly to their ethos, and means we can trust them to do the right thing and continually expand with their consumer base

**Market Reaction**

* Buy rating, and $16 PT from Cannacord Genuity analyst Maria Ripps.
* Buy rating, and $14 PT from Jefferies
* The stock IPO’ed at $10, and has slowly risen and is at $11.35 on 6/15/2021.
* Fidelity owns 8.3% of $BARK, which is an impressive sign of their confidence in the company. In addition they ANCHORED THE PIPE!

**Investment Highlights**

Barkbox is a real company, with real revenues. The team has demonstrated it can execute. As investors, the goal is to find the next big thing. Without a doubt, as Barkbox continues executing in many of it’s new divisions, it will become a highly coveted gem.

* The pet category is big and growing
* This is a digitally focused brand, which is doing both DTC and collaborating with major brands for increased exposure
* It uses data, to improve the subscription experience and to personalize the box/product for its clients - STRONG RETENTION!
* It can continue to accelerate growth by introducing new products, cross selling, and adding more channels.

**Business Model:** Barkbox will continue to grow it’s subscription services direct to consumers, in addition to distributing its products with retailers like Amazon.

**Defensibility:** Barkbox has an impressive 1.8 million base of recurring consumers, and is considered one of the biggest subscription services.

**Capital:** Thanks to it’s recent IPO, it is flush with cash

&lt;li&gt;With over 50% of the e-commerce market on Amazon, Barkbox’s new inclusion into Amazon subscription will boost it’s existing revenue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Opportunity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$36.9 billion is estimated to be spent on food in 2020&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$19.2 billion is estimated to be spent on supplies/otc medicine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$29.3 billion is estimated to be spent on vet care&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://todaysveterinarybusiness.com/pets-appa-survey-covid/""&gt;During covid, an estimated 11.38 million US households have gotten a new pet.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Petcare market in the USA is more than $50 billion and will continue to grow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pet industry is mostly dominated by brick and mortar retailers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The pet market is in the early stages of innovation and is brimming for something new.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to&lt;a href=""https://securecdn.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Subscription-Commerce-Conversion-Index-November-2020.pdf""&gt; PYMNTS.com&lt;/a&gt;, ¾ of US adults - 182 million consumers, subscribed to at least 1 subscription service since last July. Nearly 50% of consumers who signed on for a new subscription since the pandemic began intend to stick with it even after the pandemic is over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here is the overview on Barkbox&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Barkbox&lt;/strong&gt; is the first &lt;strong&gt;full spectrum&lt;/strong&gt; dog brand that is capitalizing on all aspects of the human relationship with his/her best friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fun&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Health&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Food&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Essentials&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barkbox has a product for every situation, and it has a loyal customer base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Product&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fun: Barkbox launched in 2012, with its signature monthly toys/treats box.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fun with Big Dogs: Barkbox launched its &lt;a href=""https://www.barkbox.com/super-chewer""&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bark Super Chewer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2017, a line of super durable toys.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Essentials: Barkbox launched &lt;em&gt;Bark Home&lt;/em&gt; in 2019, selling essentials (beds, leashes, collars).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Health: Barkbox launched &lt;a href=""https://www.barkbox.com/brightdental""&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bark Bright&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2020, selling dog dental solutions, and health/wellness goods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Food: Bark launched &lt;a href=""https://hello.barkeats.com/?utm_source=box_header""&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bark Eats&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2020, personalized health food blends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong Economics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The average life time of a subscriber is 16.1 months&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The customer acquisition cost is “paid back” within 4 months&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return on customer acquisition cost is over &lt;strong&gt;350%&lt;/strong&gt; in 2 years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over the last several years, Barkbox has increased gross profit per subscription, while reducing customer acquisition costs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High Margin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Barkbox gross margin is ~60%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In comparison, Chewy, a marketplace for pet products, is around ~25%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Media&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$BARK has 8.5 million social media followers, even though it specifically focuses on dogs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$CHWY in comparison has ~2.3 million on Facebook/Instagram combined, even though it focuses on all types of pets..not just dogs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Growth Levers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expanding into new product categories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Growing subscriptions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cross-selling new products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Growing retail, and e-commerce channels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cost efficiencies only possible with more scale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build “own” facilities to do warehouse and fulfillment, which will improve customer experience too&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Team&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former co-founder of Meetup, Matt Meeker, is Executive Chairman/Co-Founder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former Director of Amazon Global is CEO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Members of the management team have been featured in Fast Company’s list of “Most Creative People,” and Forbes “30 under 30”, among other accolades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Omni-channel Distribution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Barkbox has built an impressive brand, and it collaborates with retail partners in addition to selling directly to consumers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s distributed by major retailers such as: Target, Amazon, &lt;a href=""https://dogoday.com/2021/02/04/costco-barkbox-collection-is-back-and-its-super-cute/""&gt;Costco&lt;/a&gt;, Walmart, and Petsmart&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It does joint collaborations with brand such as &lt;a href=""https://bluestonelane.com/barkxbluestone/""&gt;Bluestone Lane&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href=""https://barkpost.com/life/bark-budweiser-7-pack/""&gt;Anheuser-Bush&lt;/a&gt;, among many others, such as the &lt;a href=""https://www.barkbox.com/themes/NBA""&gt;NBA&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Barkbox has over 1.8 million annual active subscribers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an investment deck for the popular App Acorns, BarkBox was mentioned as having one of the biggest subscriber bases, alongside big brands such as: NYTimes, Dropbox, Peloton, and Spotify - due to its impressive subscriber base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Competition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barkbox has no true competitors. Most brands exist in their own individual silo, i.e. just food, or toys. Other competitors like Chewy, are marketplaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$HIMS is a consumer subscription based model, that seems to be a good peer for comparison purposes. Due $HIMS recurring subscription revenue model, it is a good comparison for discussions. Based on $HIMS valuation, this would support $BARK trading in the $15-20 area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For general purposes, I have included a comparison of other pet related brands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CHWY - Chewy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FRPT - Freshpet&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TRUP - Trupanion&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No DD is complete without thinking about the bear case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most recently, Chewy, a competitor of $BARK, reported profits but warned of labor shortages and supply disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though $BARK is vertically integrated, it is likely that it will have the same labor and supply disruptions, as all businesses are facing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly before it’s IPO, $BARK was accused of selling a chew stick that killed a pet. There is no evidence the chew stick was responsible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead of ignoring the allegation, Barkbox immediately addressed it via social media, and said it was working with the manufacturer to look into the death.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Barkbox immediately stopped distributing the item.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Their emphasis on “doing the right thing,” speaks loudly to their ethos, and means we can trust them to do the right thing and continually expand with their consumer base&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Market Reaction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy rating, and $16 PT from Cannacord Genuity analyst Maria Ripps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy rating, and $14 PT from Jefferies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The stock IPO’ed at $10, and has slowly risen and is at $11.35 on 6/15/2021.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fidelity owns 8.3% of $BARK, which is an impressive sign of their confidence in the company. In addition they ANCHORED THE PIPE!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investment Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barkbox is a real company, with real revenues. The team has demonstrated it can execute. As investors, the goal is to find the next big thing. Without a doubt, as Barkbox continues executing in many of it’s new divisions, it will become a highly coveted gem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The pet category is big and growing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is a digitally focused brand, which is doing both DTC and collaborating with major brands for increased exposure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It uses data, to improve the subscription experience and to personalize the box/product for its clients - STRONG RETENTION!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can continue to accelerate growth by introducing new products, cross selling, and adding more channels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Business Model:&lt;/strong&gt; Barkbox will continue to grow it’s subscription services direct to consumers, in addition to distributing its products with retailers like Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defensibility:&lt;/strong&gt; Barkbox has an impressive 1.8 million base of recurring consumers, and is considered one of the biggest subscription services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capital:&lt;/strong&gt; Thanks to it’s recent IPO, it is flush with cash&lt;/p&gt;

107,,ValueInvesting,"Hello all,

It will be great to have a discussion and to have your options noon on value investing with boosters or turbos.
For those who are not very familiar with the terms, these are high risk financial instruments (derivatives) that give more exposure to the investor to the changes of the stock price. The risk is that the boosters and turbos have a finance level (imagine that the broker is financing a part of the stock's price for you) which when reached results in 100% loss and automatic termination of the position. The instruments that I have seen do not have an expiry date.
I'm actually not sure if such products are available worldwide, but at least in Europe there are at least couple of providers.

So here is the dilemma: why would a value investor who has done a good research of a company, is convinced of its long-term prosperity and growth and plans to hold long term, not buy boosters/turbos instead of regular shares? If looking at a a certain milestone a head in the future anyway, why not have the profits boosted?

An obvious limitation long-term is the price fluctuation and there can be dips in the stock price that can approach or even reach the finance level of the instrument. But wouldn't a 30-40-50% drop in a stock price, although temporary, be indicative of a bad stock pick?

To give an example, BABA seems like a good candidate for a booster/turbo instrument. The stock price is depressed while the business looks rock solid (unlike the political and regulatory situation around it). With a long term horizon the current risk can be well offset if the expected price target in the future is x2 or X3 the analysts' estimations. Does this steategy seem to naive and rosy?

111,,ValueInvesting,"Hello,

Anyone used to Equity Risk Premium concept can give me support on this?

Equity Risk Premium (ERP) is the market reference (oftenly relying on S&amp;P 500) returns discounting the risk free rate (usually defined from US 5 or 10  years bond rate).  Equity Risk Premium plays a major role in discount rate definition. Valuation models consider the Equity Risk Premium as a historic value. In some cases it's calculated (as 4.7%)  from 1929 S&amp;P 500 returns! 

In my opinion, it doens't have any sense to calculate ERP in so wide time interval. The Risk Premium should be aligned to the same time interval as beta calculation and alpha return (according to Capital Assets Pricing Model).  

 So, for example for 10 years the ERP is at 10%, what makes the discount rate quite high as value target stocks generally perform with Beta values higher than 1.

So, what do you think about ERP, should be aligned with Beta and alpha or should be considered as a historical value from a mature market?",t2_9jh3pcz2,False,,0,False,Equity Risk Premium time definition,[],r/ValueInvesting,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_o0pmh6,False,dark,0.72,,public,3,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Question / Help,False,3,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1623822908.0,text,6,,,text,self.ValueInvesting,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;

One of the things I see most on Reddit are people trying to out-think each other in terms of identifying complex business models/situations, over-guessing their near-term future, which is then (sadly) perceived as the only way to outperform.

That is just not true, and candidly, may lead you to some bad decisions.

I titled this post a quote from Peter Lynch because I think it paints the truest way of thinking when it comes to investing.

Therefore, it is not the complexity of your idea that will grant you your gains, it is how well you are able to handle volatility and stay true to your original story. (A lot easier said than done)

All of this to say is don't try to outthink yourself or even others.

This week, Apple's World Wide Developer Conference kicked off with a jam-packed keynote featuring a host of software and services updates. A common thread throughout the event was an emphasis on enabling Apple users to share data and experiences seamlessly throughout its ecosystem, all with privacy in mind.

SharePlay, an open API for synchronous content streaming, will enable users to listen to Apple Music or watch a show from HBO Max together with family and friends on a FaceTime call. Combined with Spatial Audio call scheduling and enhanced sharing features in iMessage, the new service will make communication on an Apple device more immersive and convenient.
In a push to address the digital identity problem and eliminate the need for physical wallets, Apple announced Digital ID, a digital copy of a user's driver's license or state ID, which the TSA intends to adopt. Apple could leverage this digital identity to reduce the friction in the authentication for apps and services.
Apple Health users will be able to share data like activity levels, sleep quality, and heart rates with their physicians and loved ones. This data could inform treatment decisions and alert family members to changes in health associated with irregular heartbeats and accidental falls, among many others.

120,,ValueInvesting,"I have created a sum of parts valuation of Alibaba with the following components

1. Lazada : 83% stake?

83% \* 130b (As Lazada is slightly smaller than SE) = **108b USD.**

2) Eleme (Alibaba’s food delivery service which they purchased 2018 at 9.5b USD)

Meituan is backed by Tencent (TCEHY) and will represent many proxy battles between BABA and Tencent in China. With 31% total market share we can roughly estimate the value of Eleme to be 300b\* (31%/67.3%) = 138b USD

3) Ant Financial 30% Stake.

Current ANT Market cap… UNKNOWN. I am going to be conservative and assume 2/3 of value has been lost since IPO, such I am going to value (conservatively) ANT at 100b \* 30% BABA stake = 30b USD

4) Cainiao (BABA’s equivalent to JD Logistics)

JD Logistic ticker symbol [2618.HK](https://2618.hk/) this had IPO’ed in 2021 at 260b HKD = 41b USD. It is quite difficult to compare the two as not much information is available. JD appears to operate with possible slightly more advanced technology, however BABA has significantly larger scale of operations (1 Trillion of sales in 2020 for BABA vs 114b USD

I am valuing it at 41b USD

5) Venture Capital.

This one is almost impossible valuate as Alibaba and Tencent are Chinas two largest VC firms and have a small to large stake in what appears everything. 80% of Chinese tech startups have taken a form of investment from BAT Bidu, Alibaba, Tencent) by the time they reach $5 billion in valuation. Tencent’s listed and unlisted investments were worth some $259 billion in total as of March 2 2021. If we add an arbitrary 50b as to represent the remainder of BABA’s VC

Adding

1+2+3+4+5 = 240b

6) Cash BABA as of Q12021 had 75b in cash in the books

So 240b + 75b = 315b.

**Current BABA Market cap as of June 13 2021 is 575 Billion**

Which means we are buying an ecommerce business generating 27 billion in cashflow and that just grew revenue at 34% and the largest cloud in Asia growing revenue at 40% for 575b - 315b = **260b. Almost 9x 2020 cash flow.**

Hi,

I'm trying to plan a roadmap to start my journey to becoming a value investor.

So far, I'm liking the idea of reading The Intelligent Investor alongside Security Analysis. I have my foundations in STEM so I'm not afraid of a dive into the deep end, so to speak.

But I'm undecided as to whether or not to throw Trading and Exchanges into the mix of literature to begin with. It seems important to know how the markets work, the people that participate in the markets, and various other things that I'm convinced are important after reading what the book is about.

But 600 pages seems intense for those topics, but I don't know.

Any advice is appreciated!",t2_31qhmndg,False,,0,False,Market Microstructure's important for the Value Investor?,[],r/ValueInvesting,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_nyvsov,False,dark,1.0,,public,2,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Books,False,2,,False,True,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1623617978.0,text,6,,,text,self.ValueInvesting,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Importance&lt;/p&gt;

working capital, also known as ‘’net working capital’’ is a measure of company’s short-term liquidity and operational efficiency as the traditional formula says it’ calculated as follows: **Current assets – current liabilities and we get the working capital**, but that’s not quite right and here were going to explain why its wrong and are there more precise ways to calculate working capital.

**Working capital why does it matter**

To value any Company’s value we must estimate its **future cash flows** for X periods of time and then discount them back to present to get a valuation.

Cash flow differs from net income since, cash flow show statement tells us amount of real cash that was flowing in or out of the business, whereas net income that’s is the bottom line of income statement is partly derived from *non-cash accounts* for example items like accounts receivables which isn’t real cashthe firm has it's just a claim that the company is waiting to get its payment for services already provided.

**Why do we care about working capital**

It all comes down to valuations in order to value a business we need to identify its cash flows for future periods and then discount them back to present a**nd the Big component of cash flows are changes made in working capital and how is the working capital calculated**

Lets, take an example For Target company the

[https://imgur.com/VurwtMh](https://imgur.com/VurwtMh)

**Traditional way to calculate Working Capital**

would be to calculate current assets and minus Current liabilities in our case

2020 WC= 12902-14487= (1585) so for target we have working capital minus 1585

The problem is this not the way how companies calculate Working capital and how they present this on Cash flow statement **better way to calculate working capital would be following**

**Current operational Assets- current operational liabilities**

**\*\*Excluding cash debt and investments. \*\***

But how do we identify what are exactly operational assets and liabilities? We need to look at the cash flow statement.

If you look at target corp’s Cash flow statement they use the following To calculate changes in Cash from operations

Target chooses to write in operating accounts

1)Inventory

2)Other assets

3)Accounts payable

4)Accrued and other liabilities

They haven’t mentioned anything about cash, debt and ETC when talking about their operational accounts why should you?

The basic rule is that there are going to be variations from company to Company but the main idea is to look at their financials and understand how the company itself defines working capital and its changes

Cash flow from operating activities&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Changes in operating accounts&gt;&gt;&gt; and seeing the list of what it consists of.

for target it was inventory other assets and accounts payable

**More precise Working capital would be following for TARGET**

*Current assets=Inventory+ Other assets*

*Current liabilities=Acc. payable+ accrued and other liabilities*

So we would have:

10325-14326= (4001)

This will let us to understand more deeply what the business itself is refers to Its Working capital.

**ANOTHER EXAMPLE FOR $LMT**

Let’s see another company Lockheed martin’s income and cash flow statement and lets measure its working capital

We see no signs of cash or debt being mentioned in working capital

Screenshot quality was damn low so just pasted it right here  

\*\***The $773 million improvement in cash flows related to working capital (defined as receivables, contract assets, and inventories less accounts payable and contract liabilities) \*\***

By reading $LMT’s 10-K we know that company defines working capital as shown in the screenshot

**Current operational assets are**

*Accounts receivable*

*Contract assets*

*Inventory*

**Current operational liabilities are**

*Accounts payable*

*Contract liabilities*

Now let’s go back To income statement the calculate Working capital

[https://imgur.com/mB9vqQo](https://imgur.com/mB9vqQo)

(Receivables+ Contract assets+ inventory) - (Accounts payable+ contract liabilities)

$15,068-$8,425=$6,643

The general rule would be not to asses your own perception of working capital for every company, rather understand how does the company itself defines working capital.

and if your still here thank you for your time!

155,,ValueInvesting,"I can’t help to notice how many popular stocks recently have been following a pattern of manipulation, particularly $GEO and $WISH. Their pattern is distinctly different from the manic buying that happened early on with $GME.

With $GME the behavior was that traders bought shares over a period of many days. This can be seen in the rise and fall of the stock over a period of well over a week (Jan 21 - Feb 4 2021). This makes a lot of sense as retail investors generally are not constantly making trades and don’t even possess software to issue fast trades (most brokers have a delay in order execution). This is what I’d expect if a stock is being manipulated by a group of people, coordinating actions takes time and no everyone is a professional trader.

With $WISH and $GEO, we see a different pattern (although both were pumped on Reddit). Here, there is a fast rise and a fast fall over the course of 1 day. Interestingly enough both rallies end at market close when they started. The next day the rallies mysteriously die and both stocks return to normal. If both were being pumped by a group of independent individuals, I just don’t see how such a pattern would emerge, especially if the individuals were not already seasoned traders (which the general public is not).

Why is this highly suspicious?
First both rallies end at day end. This is setting a perfect trap for individual investors who are not constantly checking the market. With such a strong rally the general public is bound to believe that the rally will continue on the next day. Also, they’re likely to check the news at the end of the day.

How could an attacker profit?
By planning the date in advance, one or many attackers can simply buy low priced options for the given date at the expected strike price. By coordinating a mass buying (GEO and WISH have relatively low volume and market cap), the attacker can raise the price (especially due to mark to market). His options would substantially rise in price, which he could unload at a hefty profit. By selling the stock to the general public the day after the rally, the price would go back down (again, most of the general public is unlikely to quickly sell, hence the price would go back to what it was). The attacker makes a hefty profit on the options, and likely no loss (maybe even a profit) on the stock. I estimate that 200M would be able to easily make such moves for both GEO and WISH. 200M is not an insane amount for a fund.

157,,ValueInvesting,"Hey all,

I’m just starting to invest and have found a philosophical connection to value investing. Couple questions to help a newbie along are: 

1) I’m planning on adding $1000 a month to my account. Should a value investor set that money aside until a good buy comes along or should a person purchase stocks monthly.

2) My initial thought has been to invest for the first couple months into Toyota Motors, as I like the company, read positive things about how they produce vehicles, and recently had a positive experience purchasing a vehicle from them. I know my education of financials is in its infancy and will need to grow to make better long term picks, but what other things do you look for when you want to research a company? For me, it seems like having a positive experience with a company will lead to researching it.

3) Any podcast recommendations or audio books? Ive listened to Phil Towns Invested podcast and have enjoyed it so far, but I appreciate hearing other voices. I’m working on my MBA outside of work, so I’m having a bit of overlap with my courses, but reading investment books won’t realistically happen until October.

Overall, my thought is that I’ll learn investing by trial in my 30’s (I’m 31) and then once I’m in my 40’s I’ll have a longer term strategy ironed out, hopefully.

&lt;p&gt;Overall, my thought is that I’ll learn investing by trial in my 30’s (I’m 31) and then once I’m in my 40’s I’ll have a longer term strategy ironed out, hopefully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any other tidbits of information or wisdom would be greatly appreciated :)&lt;/p&gt;

**Business Size Up**

Home Depot is the world's largest home improvement retailer. Home Depot operates 2,291 stores in North America: USA (86.5%), Canada (8%) and Mexico (5.5%), along with a network of distribution and fulfillment centers. Home Depot serves two core markets Do-It-Yourself (DIY) (60% of sales) and professional contractors (Pros) (40% of sales.) 9.3% of Home Depot's sales came from e-commerce platforms, up 19.3% over 2018.

*Strategy*

The One Home Depot strategy is a 5-year 11-billion-dollar investment plan beginning in 2017 with three goals:

* Revamp Home Depots' supply chain.
* Improve Home Depot's technology platform.
* Remodel physical locations. 

Home Depot's supply chain revamp seeks to achieve the fastest delivery capabilities in the home improvement sector. By upgrading existing facilities and adding 150 new fulfillment facilities, Home Depot plans to enable next-day delivery for 90% of US households. Upstream distribution capacity through fulfillment centers reduces the burden on individual stores. Stores will no-longer require warehouse functionality as ""*ship from store""* is phased out in major markets. As inventory becomes more centralized and delivery speed increases, stores can carry less inventory, reducing Home Depot's working capital. Home Depot's best-in-class supply chain is a distinct competitive advantage that will allow them to avoid disruption by online-only retailers. The supply chain needed to deliver home-improvement items, usually big and heavy, is different from electronics and small goods in which online retailers specialize. Home Depot's store footprint provides another competitive advantage as the appearance of goods and installation advice from industry professionals is highly valued. In 2019, customers picked up 50% of Home Depot's online orders in-store.

Home Depot seeks to improve both DIY and Pro experiences through investments in technology and store upgrades. Home Depot is investing in improving its website and creating personalized customer engagements from the design to the purchase decision. Home Depot's store upgrades include an app that allows customers to locate materials independently. The store investments include a redesigned front-end, more intuitive product stocking and online order pickup lockers. Pro initiatives include inventory management systems, custom product offerings, in-store Pro desk services, and enhanced credit programs. Home Depot's Pro Xtra loyalty program is a competitive advantage as Home Depot offers exclusive products, product discounts, dedicated sales staff and other services (mentioned above) that differentiate it from Lowes (Home Depot's closest competitor).

Home Depot has friendly shareholder policies. A continuously growing dividend, maintaining a high ROIC through returning excess liquidity to shareholders and conducting share repurchases after the business needs are met. Home Depot should see an acceleration in both dividend and share repurchases post 2022, as the accelerated capital expenditures from the One Home Depot strategy ends.

**Industry**

Being the largest home improvement business gives Home Depot significant power over suppliers. Home Depot sources merchandise from many different suppliers through a bidding system. The bidding system allows Home Depot to diversify its suppliers with no individual supplier accounting for more than 10% of inventory and gives Home Depot the power to drop individual suppliers without a negative impact on their business.

Individual buyers in the DIY segment do not significantly impact Home Depot as the incremental buyer has a small ticket size and visits the store on average five times a year. Pro customers have greater pricing power on Home Depot, as each pro customer contributes a significantly higher percentage of revenues than an individual DIY customer. Pro customers are more likely to cross-shop with Lowes and other smaller providers for the best price. Home Depot adds value to Pro's businesses through Pro services and offers special sales staff for Pros, saving time.

The Amazon effect has the potential to alter the current duopoly in the home improvement market. E-commerce risk is significant; however, I believe that the home improvement sector is somewhat shielded thanks to considerably higher shipping costs for big and bulky items and a much more complicated supply chain needed to deliver products in a similar timeframe. Making entering the home improvement industry an inefficient use of capital in the short-to-medium-term.

Most of the products Home Depot provides are commodities or can be purchased at competitors. As customers have no switching costs, Home Depot must continue to deliver low prices and good service to keep customers. Suggesting that margins have limited room to expand. With two major players (Home Depot and Lowes) the home improvement market is mature. Market saturation suggests any growth in the pie will be split amongst the two firms and that both firms will compete on price and service to retain their market position.

The drivers of the home improvement sector are per capita savings rates, private spending on home improvements, age of housing stock and housing starts. Through 2020 the savings rate in America increased from an average of 7.4% in the five years preceding the pandemic to 17.1% as of January 2021 (Fig 1)(FRED). Higher savings rates combined with greater demand for housing will increase housing starts and housing turnover. Both of which should spur demand for home building and improvement supplies. Home improvement sales are correlated to home turnover, increasing home prices and aging of US housing. Due to the age and condition of the US housing stock new owners often invest in home improvement upgrades over purchasing a larger home. Due to these trends the home improvement market is expected to grow at 4.2% from 2020-2025. (Ibis)

**Risks**

Home Depot's sales are tied to the housing market, which is driven by interest rates. If rates rise significantly in the future, home values will fall, causing a drop in consumer demand. As home values plummet, undertaking a large reinvestment plan into a property may no-longer make sense.

E-commerce allows competitors to easily enter HD's industry, provide price transparency and allows consumers to comparison shop for most items. Lowes has been a large beneficiary of cross-shopping as they are focused on gaining market share. Lowes has historically been a winner with DIY customers; however, now Lowes is placing increasing emphasis on Pro customers. Increasing competition could force HD to compete more heavily on price, placing pressure on margins downwards.

Home Depot purchased HD Supply in Nov. 2020. Home Depot must successfully integrate Interline with HD Supply to achieve economies of scale. HD Supply was purchased for 8 billion (10% of assets), integration failure would cause a multi-year drag on earnings.

**Financial Review**

Home Depot maintains a strong financial position in 2021. During 2020 Home Depot experienced a 19.9% increase in sales; Home Depot managed to retain \~34% gross profit margin, their long-term average since 2006 (Fig 2). Retaining Home Depot's long-run average profit margin is evidence of its supply chain resilience. Another positive is days of inventory went down 5%, showing investments in its supply chain are paying dividends. Home Depot is holding significantly more cash than prior years \~7.9 billion (Fig 3). Home Depot is holding this cash to allow for increased flexibility during 2021 - I believe that Home Depot will return this capital to shareholders within the next 24 months through buybacks to normalizes its cash balance (7.7 billion buybacks authorized). 

Home Depot is a stable business with minimal CAPEX needs. Over the past five years, CAPEX has been 2% of sales / 21% of net income. Management has guided CAPEX should stay in this range into the future. Home Depot's advantage is that they are the largest player in the home improvement space, giving home depot CAPEX economies of scale. For Lowes to match Home Depot's CAPEX spend, it would need to invest close to 1.5x the percentage of sales and net income. Other important sources and uses of cash are highlighted in Fig 5. I expect share repurchases to normalize over the next year to 66% of operating income (Fig 5).

**Future Business Prospects**

I believe that Home Depot will strengthen over the next five years and continue to lead the home improvement sector. The home improvement sector has multiple positive drivers: low mortgage rates driving home prices higher, 40% of US homes being over 40 years old, high consumer savings rates and a surge in new construction adding capacity to the housing market. We are also seeing families allocate more of their wallets to home improvement. Additionally, with greater demand for housing among millennials, there will be greater housing turnover, a driver for home improvement revenues. I have reflected these ideas through a *5.7%* revenue CAGR. To account for pulled demand forward, which resulted in a 20% increase in sales during 2021, I have taken guidance from Lowes, which expects their sales to drop by 7% in 2022. I used a 3% decline for Home Depot because of their HD Supply acquisition. Acquiring the market leader in the maintenance and repairs sector provides Home Depot significant operational synergies. Home Depot can exercise greater buying power and achieve cost synergies by integrating the Interline platform with HD Supply.

I believe that Home Depot's supply chain improvements will yield significant savings - as it allows Home Depot to have significantly less working capital and allows employees to be more productive as stocking takes less time. I believe that competition for Pro clients from Lowes will not allow Home Depot to reduce their COGS margins significantly. I believe that industry-wide operating expenses will increase as firms pay to retain knowledgeable staff and increase cleaning into the long-term. To reflect these ideas, I have improved Home Depot's COGS margins by *1.0%* while increasing operating expenses by *2.0%* over the period. The other notable change is implementing Joe Biden's proposed *28%* tax rate from 2023 to 2026.",t2_4cvyl187,False,,0,False,Home Depot Analysis,[],r/ValueInvesting,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_nxn9tr,False,dark,1.0,,public,8,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Stock Analysis,False,8,,False,False,self,1623442310.0,,[],{},,True,,1623466184.0,text,6,,,text,self.ValueInvesting,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have included by business size up here but I couldn&amp;#39;t add photo&amp;#39;s (exhibits) and the post was looking long so I have included a link to my substack for the entire write-up ~1500 words&lt;/p&gt;

165,,ValueInvesting,"I have written the following summary with sources mainly from aswath damodaran. Hopefully it helps.

## Background

The advanced accounting system was developed during the industrial revolution for manufacturing firms and since economies are shifting away from manufacturing to technology and service related businesses, accountants have had a tough job keeping up, you will see many inconsistencies reflect the shift away in the economy. Accounting created during a very different century with a different economy.

## Taxes

Tax in the income statement might not match up to what the company pays out as taxes. So that difference shows up as a deferred tax and builds up over time either as an asset or liabilities.

On a company’s balance sheet, deferred tax [assets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deferredtaxasset.asp) &amp; [liabilities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deferredtaxliability.asp) are reflections of expectations of taxes in the future or due for the current period. 

For example, if it's a money losing company, it obviously doesn't pay taxes (maybe that could change under the recent G7/French big tech revenue tax proposals for big companies, who knows). It also allows us to take those losses and carry them forward/backwards. You are allowed to take that loss and set it off against the income in a future year.

* So one of the things to look at is to determine whether there’s a [Net Operating Loss (NOL)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/netoperatingloss.asp) and;
* secondly, how much that NOL is; because it will affect your tax payments in the future.

Taxes that are paid in the income statement might not reflect what the company actually pays but the giveaway would be to look in the cash flow statement because it will reflect the difference. So combining a cash flow statement with an income statement will give a sense of taxes.

## Stock based compensation

Some companies pay stock compensation to give employees an incentive to align them with the company, i.e a lot of the FAANG companies do this to align employees to the companies goals.

Also, if the company cannot afford (for not having enough cash) to pay salaries to their employees, then they pay with stock (giving away a piece of their company). This mostly occurs in startups though.

To the extent that you’re paying with stock to keep employees working for you, it has to be treated as an employee compensation thus means that it’s an operating expense.  

In 2004, the rules changed for granted options as they were treated as giving away nothing because accountants valued options as [exercise value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exerciseprice.asp). By looking at the income statements in US/EU companies, if companies do give employees compensation in the form of stocks/options then it will show a line item and that line item reflects the value of the grant at the time of the grant. So it is an operating expense and not a cash flow. 

When computing the cash flows for a company, we should not be adding back stock based compensation because you are giving away a slice of the equity which will not be attributable to shareholders. The rule now is that if you grant with stock it’s going to be treated as an expense which is the correct way.

## Leases

Let’s assume that the company took the 10-year lease and the contract requires the company to make lease payments every year for the next 10 years. This is called contractual commitment and what that means is that the company has to pay in good and bad years. Because it's a fixed payment where your business will cease to exist if you don’t pay the lease it’s essentially a form of debt and should be treated as such.

The accountants made the ownership the center of their decision making, if you don’t have an ownership of an asset, they will not treat these lease commitments as debt. The latter were called operating leases. In 2019, US companies show capital leases as debt and operating leases as operating expenses. In non-US companies, all these lease commitments are often treated as operating lease expenses. So financing expenses were treated as an operating expense. A good example of this was Spirit Airlines 10K in 2020. It looked healthy on the balance sheets but in the footnotes it has a huge amount of leases attributable to Boeing that it was hiding.

&gt;A new **FASB** rule, effective Dec. 15, 2018, requires that all **leases**—unless they are shorter than **12 months**—must be recognized on the balance sheet.

Now all lease commitments are treated as debt (unless they are less than 12 months). When you do the computation, make sure that all leases are treated as debt in your valuations including &lt; 12 month leases. Otherwise your balance sheet won’t be balanced.

## Research and Development

If you have an expense that creates benefits and generates future growth over many years, it’s a capital expense. If you have an expense that creates only this year, it’s an operating expense. So, R&amp;D should be treated as [capital expenditures](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalexpenditure.asp) (CAPEX) even though they are not by accountants.

To compute the R&amp;D:

1. specify an amortizable life, how many years does it take;
2. collect R&amp;D from past years. Let’s say it's been spread out over 5 years. How much of that expense is being written off this year and how much is still left over. The amount that’s being written off this year will be amortized will show up as an expense; the amount that’s not been written off from previous years will now show up in the balance sheet (capital invested in R&amp;D);

Hopefully it helps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advanced accounting system was developed during the industrial revolution for manufacturing firms and since economies are shifting away from manufacturing to technology and service related businesses, accountants have had a tough job keeping up, you will see many inconsistencies reflect the shift away in the economy. Accounting created during a very different century with a different economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Taxes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tax in the income statement might not match up to what the company pays out as taxes. So that difference shows up as a deferred tax and builds up over time either as an asset or liabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a company’s balance sheet, deferred tax &lt;a href=""https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deferredtaxasset.asp""&gt;assets&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=""https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deferredtaxliability.asp""&gt;liabilities&lt;/a&gt; are reflections of expectations of taxes in the future or due for the current period. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if it&amp;#39;s a money losing company, it obviously doesn&amp;#39;t pay taxes (maybe that could change under the recent G7/French big tech revenue tax proposals for big companies, who knows). It also allows us to take those losses and carry them forward/backwards. You are allowed to take that loss and set it off against the income in a future year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So one of the things to look at is to determine whether there’s a &lt;a href=""https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/netoperatingloss.asp""&gt;Net Operating Loss (NOL)&lt;/a&gt; and;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;secondly, how much that NOL is; because it will affect your tax payments in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taxes that are paid in the income statement might not reflect what the company actually pays but the giveaway would be to look in the cash flow statement because it will reflect the difference. So combining a cash flow statement with an income statement will give a sense of taxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Stock based compensation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some companies pay stock compensation to give employees an incentive to align them with the company, i.e a lot of the FAANG companies do this to align employees to the companies goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, if the company cannot afford (for not having enough cash) to pay salaries to their employees, then they pay with stock (giving away a piece of their company). This mostly occurs in startups though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the extent that you’re paying with stock to keep employees working for you, it has to be treated as an employee compensation thus means that it’s an operating expense.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2004, the rules changed for granted options as they were treated as giving away nothing because accountants valued options as &lt;a href=""https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exerciseprice.asp""&gt;exercise value&lt;/a&gt;. By looking at the income statements in US/EU companies, if companies do give employees compensation in the form of stocks/options then it will show a line item and that line item reflects the value of the grant at the time of the grant. So it is an operating expense and not a cash flow. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When computing the cash flows for a company, we should not be adding back stock based compensation because you are giving away a slice of the equity which will not be attributable to shareholders. The rule now is that if you grant with stock it’s going to be treated as an expense which is the correct way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Leases&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s assume that the company took the 10-year lease and the contract requires the company to make lease payments every year for the next 10 years. This is called contractual commitment and what that means is that the company has to pay in good and bad years. Because it&amp;#39;s a fixed payment where your business will cease to exist if you don’t pay the lease it’s essentially a form of debt and should be treated as such.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The accountants made the ownership the center of their decision making, if you don’t have an ownership of an asset, they will not treat these lease commitments as debt. The latter were called operating leases. In 2019, US companies show capital leases as debt and operating leases as operating expenses. In non-US companies, all these lease commitments are often treated as operating lease expenses. So financing expenses were treated as an operating expense. A good example of this was Spirit Airlines 10K in 2020. It looked healthy on the balance sheets but in the footnotes it has a huge amount of leases attributable to Boeing that it was hiding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new &lt;strong&gt;FASB&lt;/strong&gt; rule, effective Dec. 15, 2018, requires that all &lt;strong&gt;leases&lt;/strong&gt;—unless they are shorter than &lt;strong&gt;12 months&lt;/strong&gt;—must be recognized on the balance sheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now all lease commitments are treated as debt (unless they are less than 12 months). When you do the computation, make sure that all leases are treated as debt in your valuations including &amp;lt; 12 month leases. Otherwise your balance sheet won’t be balanced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Research and Development&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have an expense that creates benefits and generates future growth over many years, it’s a capital expense. If you have an expense that creates only this year, it’s an operating expense. So, R&amp;amp;D should be treated as &lt;a href=""https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalexpenditure.asp""&gt;capital expenditures&lt;/a&gt; (CAPEX) even though they are not by accountants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To compute the R&amp;amp;D:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;specify an amortizable life, how many years does it take;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;collect R&amp;amp;D from past years. Let’s say it&amp;#39;s been spread out over 5 years. How much of that expense is being written off this year and how much is still left over. The amount that’s being written off this year will be amortized will show up as an expense; the amount that’s not been written off from previous years will now show up in the balance sheet (capital invested in R&amp;amp;D);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;then you have to adjust your earnings, so that the entire perspective on a company can change by making those shifts. Ifa we do not do R&amp;amp;D, we are going to get an asymmetrical vision of what these businesses are worth, how much the company is investing and what they are truly making.&lt;/li&gt;

Carl Icahn, George Soros, Peter Lynch, Peter Thiel, Bill Miller, Jim Rogers, and Guo Guangchang studied philosophy at the university. Icahn says that studying philosophy of the XXI prepares you for acquisitions; Peter Lynch in One Up on Wall Street assures that history and philosophy are the best preparations for investment than mathematics and statistics, and that his courses in logic and philosophy were the ones that helped him the most; Jim Rogers recommends studying history and philosophy in college; Dan Loeb says that to be a good investor you have to be a bit of a philosopher.

David Abrams, Terry Smith, James Anderson, and Nick Train majored in history. Paul Singer and Leon Levy studied psychology. Steinhardt specialized in sociology. Stanley Druckenmiller studied English. Bill Ackman studied Social Sciences. David Einhorn and Stephen Mandel studied Government.

Icahn says that studying philosophy of the XXI prepares you for acquisitions; Peter Lynch in One Up on Wall Street assures that history and philosophy are the best preparations for investment than mathematics and statistics, and that his courses in logic and philosophy were the ones that helped him the most; Jim Rogers recommends studying history and philosophy in college; Dan Loeb says that to be a good investor you have to be a bit of a philosopher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Abrams, Terry Smith, James Anderson, and Nick Train majored in history. Paul Singer and Leon Levy studied psychology. Steinhardt specialized in sociology. Stanley Druckenmiller studied English. Bill Ackman studied Social Sciences. David Einhorn and Stephen Mandel studied Government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, there is a pattern of slant towards the social sciences and the liberal arts. I personally want to pursue asset management professionally, and after reading the advice and tips of those I admire, I plan to study philosophy at university.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my question is: What do you think is the best college preparation for the investment world or what would you have studied to be a better investor?&lt;/p&gt;

172,,ValueInvesting,"Hello @ all,

I recently made a first move into the tobacco sector and am interested in your opinions. Of course i also did my own DD (DCF, multiple-approach, macro analysis) and came up to the conclusion that 2 companies seem to be crazy bargains ATM. I wonder if I overlooked something and would be grateful to hear your opinions:

Value picks:

- Imperial Brands
- British American Tobacco

Both produce tremendous FCF for years. Especially Imperial seems undervalued (probably due to weaker market position (brands and next generation products)). Even if their business declines at a modest rate (pessimistic scenario is 2% p.a. for 10 years, the IRR is above 15% in my scenario). Additional risk is the low equity ratio of approx 20% which is reasonable given their ROI is higher than cost of debt (use of leverage effect). 

Please check out tracktak for a quick DCF-check. 

BAT seems to be more stable, larger and more diversified. The big red flag is their tremendous Goodwill position due to the Reynolds acquisition in 2016.

What do you think about potential write off risk? Also: how does a company handle huge goodwill long term when the acquisition was ""valuable"" ergo no write offs in the annual impairment reviews expected. Can this work out long-term?

I really think there is too much noise and pessimism in the market. Also considering inflation fears. I think this could be a really good play for the next 10 years even considering slow decline/stagnation in the sector (high IRR even without growth!). 

Thanks in advance for your input.

[https://www.pfina.com/investor/index.php?id=263](https://www.pfina.com/investor/index.php?id=263)

On June 9, 2021 P&amp;F Industries (NASDAQ: $PFIN) received notice from the lender of the company’s $2,9MM Paycheck  Protection Program (“PPP”) loan, that the U.S. Small Business Administration approved the forgiveness of the PPP loan in its entirety. The lender has applied the funds and paid off the principal and interest of the PPP loan in full.

NOTE  - 

* This loan funded payroll and other allowed operating expenses  incurred and reported in the company's 2020 Income Statements. The PPP loan forgiveness amount will drop to the profit line as a sizable (albeit) non-recurring gain. 
* P&amp;F's overall debt has now been cut in half and is primarily the company's asset-based revolving loan. 
* Since there are  only 3,181,286  PFIN shares outstanding as of May 5, 2021, the per  share gain will be substantial.

Also a transcript of P&amp;F's most recent Q1 2021 earnings conference call can be found on  Seeking Alpha at the following link -  [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4428962-p-and-f-industries-inc-pfin-ceo-richard-horowitz-on-q1-2021-results-earnings-call-transcript](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4428962-p-and-f-industries-inc-pfin-ceo-richard-horowitz-on-q1-2021-results-earnings-call-transcript)

177,,ValueInvesting,"The stock shot up today along with GEO as the meme stock craze continues to run rampant.

So we're at $11.12 at the close (+18% today).

But unlike a lot of the crap that's melting up, CoreCivic is a legitimate investment opportunity:

* I estimate fair value of $20 per share (\~80% upside from today's close; I explain below)
* Because of its intrinsic worth, management is unlikely to file for a secondary offering, diluting existing shareholders.  In fact, their employee equity compensation plans have a strike price of $22.  Unlikely they would want to dilute themselves!
* The company generates positive free cash flow, has a healthy balance sheet, and does not need to raise equity to achieve deleveraging objectives.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Punchline:**

CoreCivic ($CXW) is a former REIT that owns and operates private prisons. The progressives hate private prisons and have driven this stock down almost -80% since 2015, after threatening to end Federal contracts with the company and pressuring banks to stop lending them money. At the current price of $11.12, the stock now trades at multiples that question it as a going concern (4.2x CY21E P/FFO, vs 13-14x historically). **I believe we have just witnessed 3.5 major catalysts over the past few months that should permanently dispel the current prevailing bias, and that the company should start making its way towards my estimated fair value of $20 (80% upside).** The stock started breaking out after the fundamental catalysts began revealing themselves, but obviously today was a big day driven by the retail mania (the 0.5th catalyst).

By the way, the company has the full backing of Michael Burry (Big Short guy) who has more than 8% of his portfolio in the stock.

&amp;#x200B;

**Net-net:** the company should not be valued as if it were going bankrupt. Once the company meets its leverage targets by mid-2023, they will commence buybacks at a 28-30% FFO yield (!), which will unlock the value in shares even if other investors don't want to.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Numbers:**

* 4.2x CY21E P/FFO (vs 13-14x historically)
* $1.3bn market cap, \~98% float
* 12mm shares short interest (\~10.2% of float)
* Total leverage ratio: 3.7x as of 1Q21 (vs 4.3x as of 1Q20; targeting 2.25-2.75x)
* $168mm in cash (not that it needs it given positive cash flow generation)
* Capital allocation priorities: pay down debt, then ***return cash to shareholders***

&amp;#x200B;

**DCF Model Assumptions:**

* 7.5% WACC, -1% long-term growth
* 100% of existing BOP revenues disappear after 3 years
* 25% of existing USMS revenues disappear after 3 years
* 2% of existing ICE revenues disappear after 3 years
* occupancy rates normalize to 79% by 2023 (from 74% today)
* unit revs grow +3% (trend-like)
* capacity declines -2% per year (trend-like)
* EBIT margins stable at 11.3%
* 5% reinvestment rate
* all incremental cash flow is used to pay down debt until 2023

&amp;#x200B;

**Company Background:**

CoreCivic has 3 main business segments: Safety, Community, and Properties. Safety is a nice word for prisons, and makes up \~90% of 2020 revenues. So this is the most important segment we need to worry about. Around 85% of revenues come from the US State and Federal governments. Within Federal (52% of revs), ICE (immigration) is 28%, USMS (US Marshals Service) is 21%, and BOP (Bureau of Prisons) is 3%. These breakdowns are important because we need to assess the degree to which Biden has the power (and means) to cancel contracts with CXW.

* ICE (28%)
   * falls under Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
   * does not have its own detention facilities
   * VERY difficult to cancel private contracts without other options
   * HIGH demand given border crisis
* USMS (21%)
   * falls under DHS
   * does not have its own detention facilities
   * VERY difficult to cancel private contracts without other options
* BOP (3%)
   * falls under the Department of Justice (DOJ)
   * DOJ was the target of Biden's latest EO to cancel private prison contracts
   * does own and operate its own detention facilities (easier to cancel private contracts)
* US State Prisons (32%)
   * fall under jurisdiction of states, meaning Biden can't touch!

&amp;#x200B;

In a realistic base case scenario, it's likely you would only see BOP contracts terminated, with maybe some USMS contracts in jeopardy. And Biden may have already turned his attention to other priorities on his agenda after issuing his EO and declaring ""victory on private prisons"" earlier this year.

The prison-government relationship is SYMBIOTIC, much like that of US-China trade - It's impossible to totally get rid of it!

&amp;#x200B;

**So the most important questions:**

* **How quickly can the company deleverage and re-prioritize shareholder returns?**
   * *I expect the company to meet leverage targets by 2023, meaning guidance on shareholder buybacks may come as early as mid-2022.*

&amp;#x200B;

* **Do political headwinds pose a risk to cash flow and its ability to execute on capital allocation priorities?**
   * *No - BOP only makes up 3% of revenues, and I don't expect a material reduction in contracts from ICE and USMS. But even in a conservative scenario where 25% of existing USMS contracts and 2% of ICE contracts are terminated, I still get my price target of $20.*
   * *In a bear case, where all BOP/USMS/ICE revenues disappear, the stock's fair value is $9.30 (i.e. yesterday's price).*

&amp;#x200B;

**Catalyst #1: Shedding REIT Status for C-Corp Status (Effective Jan 1, 2021)**

As a REIT, the company was forced to return 90% of its cash flows back to investors. But given the unique situation the company has been in (i.e. concerns around industry longevity, inability to access debt at attractive rates due to pressure on financial institutions), the company decided in 4Q20 to convert from REIT status to C-Corp status. It can now use its cash flow any way that it wants (and it's prioritizing paying down debt so it doesn't have to rely on the ridiculous cost of debt it's being penalized with). Obviously, the stock collapsed since anyone who owned this thing for dividends no longer wanted it. But now that's out of the way and the company is making progress on deleveraging.

&amp;#x200B;

**Catalyst #2: Non-Core Asset Sales and Debt Refinancing (May 13, 2021)**

The company executed non-core asset sales of \~$100mm, and refinanced some debt to push out maturities beyond 2023. This development speaks to the company's ability (and determination) to pursue deleveraging goals, and boosts credibility.

&amp;#x200B;

**Catalyst #3: New Contract at the Northeast Ohio Correctional Facility (May 28, 2021)**

This is major and what's driving the recent breakout. In April, the USMS decided not to renew their existing contract with CoreCivic at the Northeast Ohio correctional facility. The news that the company was able to fill that capacity with a new contracts speaks to outside demand for their facilities. In other words, even if some contracts from the Federal government are terminated, the company can likely find demand from other clients to replace them (i.e. local/state governments, etc.). Impressive!

&amp;#x200B;

**Catalyst #3.5: The Retail Investment Craze (June 9, 2021)**

While the focus has been on $GEO, $CXW has been grouped in since it's the only other private prison operator.  The two are oftentimes traded in pairs, so from a technical standpoint, $CXW should stand to benefit from the retail mania as well.  While $GEO may use this opportunity to restore its balance sheet, $CXW likely won't.",t2_20iz3d0o,False,,0,False,$CXW (CoreCivic) is Worth $20: The Deep Value Private Prison Sponsored by Lazy Eye Burry and The WSB Army,[],r/ValueInvesting,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_nw6fqe,False,dark,0.63,,public,11,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Stock Analysis,False,11,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1623301779.0,text,6,,,text,self.ValueInvesting,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock shot up today along with GEO as the meme stock craze continues to run rampant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Catalyst #2: Non-Core Asset Sales and Debt Refinancing (May 13, 2021)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company executed non-core asset sales of ~$100mm, and refinanced some debt to push out maturities beyond 2023. This development speaks to the company&amp;#39;s ability (and determination) to pursue deleveraging goals, and boosts credibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Catalyst #3: New Contract at the Northeast Ohio Correctional Facility (May 28, 2021)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is major and what&amp;#39;s driving the recent breakout. In April, the USMS decided not to renew their existing contract with CoreCivic at the Northeast Ohio correctional facility. The news that the company was able to fill that capacity with a new contracts speaks to outside demand for their facilities. In other words, even if some contracts from the Federal government are terminated, the company can likely find demand from other clients to replace them (i.e. local/state governments, etc.). Impressive!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Catalyst #3.5: The Retail Investment Craze (June 9, 2021)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the focus has been on $GEO, $CXW has been grouped in since it&amp;#39;s the only other private prison operator.  The two are oftentimes traded in pairs, so from a technical standpoint, $CXW should stand to benefit from the retail mania as well.  While $GEO may use this opportunity to restore its balance sheet, $CXW likely won&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;

I want to analyze firm characteristics which gives my portfolio some protection against inflation or at least a better hedge against increasing inflation.

Do you know where to start or do you have any ideas, hints how I should analyze financials when filtering for certain stocks..?
Maybe you have heard of some literature or maybe criteria which are important to analyze? 

For datapoints, I think I have to look for pricing power and moat, but how can i define them by looking at the firms financial statements?

Do I have to look for high FCF Yield, ROE or other specific margins/ratios?

The investment world listens very carefully each time Berkshire Hathaway makes a big move. Last quarter they increased the Verizon position (initiated in Q4 2020) and own right now almost 4% of the company. 

The stock price hasn't move much from the estimated average strike price ($58.70). In fact, it sits below this point and I thought this could mean buying opportunity, right?

I've been crunching the numbers and this is what I've come up so far:

* CAGR in Years 1-5: 1.86 % 
* Operating target margin in year 10: 21.41%
* Sales to capital ratio: 0.76 (Industry average)
* Probability of default: 7.54% (Estimated for BBB rating)
* Initial (Terminal) cost of capital: 3.96% (6.28%)

The estimated intrinsic value using the numbers above is **$52.64**, 8% below the price last week.

The questions:

* Am I missing something? Maybe some non-operating assets? I could not find if Verizon had any.
* What do you think made Verizon appealing to Berkshire? Inflation protection and good dividends maybe?

211,,ValueInvesting,"Whether we like it or not, we all make decisions and forecasts - large and small - every hour of every day.

In his 2015 book, Superforecasting, Tetlock revealed that based on almost two decades of research, the average “expert” was roughly as accurate as a “dart-throwing chimpanzee” in forecasting global events. However, he also discovered that a small group of people turned out to have genuine skill, and they seemed to have one key trait in common: they were great at being wrong, then learning from their mistakes to course-correct, much like a captain steering his ship. So how can we apply this in our own lives?

One simple way to do this is to use the Brier score: https://datarecipes.io/posts/brier_score/. For instance, suppose you want to buy some shares. Since shares are just pieces of businesses, you would want to do some analysis on how the business makes money, who its competitors are and how it funds itself. In fact, you could write down a handful of probabilistic predictions based on your investment thesis (e.g. 75% chance of a 10% increase in the return on equity by Q1 2022, 20% chance of a 20% increase in revenue by Q4 2021, etc.) and see how you did later. If your analysis was correct, you will have a low (good) Brier score and know that your decision was sound, even if the outcome (share price) doesn't turn out that well. Over time, hopefully, good outcomes will follow as the underlying fundamentals are reflected in the stock price (assuming your analysis is consistently correct).

214,,ValueInvesting,"On June 3 Merck completed the spinoff of their women's health division into a new traded company, Organon. 

Many value investors - from Buffett, to Munger, to Greenblatt - have said to keep an eye on spinoffs for potential mispricing. Shares of these new companies may be indiscriminately sold by holders of MRK, leading to a short term market inefficiency for value investors to scoop up.

I encourage everyone to do their own research, and post thoughts here, but just to kick things off here are a few factoids...

### Bullish

- OGN keeps about 50 established MRK brands, particularly several contraceptive products for women like NuvaRing and Implanon. Well known and commonly used products.

- Looking at the balance sheet and 2020 earnings, OGN is currently trading at a P/E of 34.15/8.53 = 4.01.

- Return on capital employed [Operating Earnings/(Assets - Current Liabilities)] is 38.46%. Very efficient! They're selling drugs that are already developed, so little CapEx needed.

- The product lines for OGN were not being emphasized by MRK, and now with a company that is pure-play on women's health, they'll be able to focus efforts more effectively in this sector.


### Bearish

- Revenues have been declining over the past 3 years on the products that OGN has. Growth will have to come from either acquisitions or R&amp;D. Does not have the same ""moat"" of patent protections that many other pharmas do.

- According to the CEO, their strategy is not to get involved with new drug development, instead partnering with young and innovative new biotech firms to help bring their products to market. (This could be either good or bad, depending on how successful that strategy is).

- The balance sheet for OGN we can see currently is parsed out from previous MRK reports and it's entirely possible that expenses will be higher/profits lower due to the cost of running an entirely separate firm for these products. The very attractive ratios we see now may not persist.

Here we’re going to try and understand the general reasons why fund managers and other institutional investors may choose to ‘’Bet against’’ a particular stock in times of upcoming/present inflation. We’re going to discuss Michael Burry’s New Put position against $TSLA. In recent Q1 of 2021 fillings Scion Asset Management disclosed they’re $500Million Put position in Tesla. Burry is betting against Tesla but don’t confuse *PUT with a SHORT* the question is what’s causing this move?

Lets start from the beginning For Michael Burry he’s been advocating the upcoming inflation Since early 2021 on his twitter account 

**ABOUT INFLATION**

as of today commodities have been rising for the past 12months, lumber prices are significantly up, Housing market is seeing a big growth, Global food prices rose for the 12th month in a row in May, up nearly 40% YOY. Numbers do like inflationary 

[Wages are rising](http://www.cnn.com/2021/05/18/economy/bank-of-america-minimum-wage/index.html) and so are [bond yields](https://money.cnn.com/data/bonds/index.html). The housing market is still chugging along. The [prices of many retail goods](https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/09/investing/stocks-week-ahead/index.html) are going up, partly because of [supply shortages](http://www.cnn.com/2021/05/15/business/supply-chain-price-increases/index.html) but also because of real demand.

&amp;#x200B;

**Relationship between Inflation, higher interest rates, and stocks**  

When anticipating higher inflation rates central banks have the tools to prevent this from happening and one way is to raise interest rates, but higher rates do have both pros and cons. But for our research lets just discuss how this affects stocks and particularly growth stock

Here's a screenshot from Visualcapitalist to demonstrate the following

High rates and Stocks 

Let’s take the period of the 1960’s-1980’s DJIA where the index advanced from 618 to 875 during 20year period, but on the other hand in the same time frame U.S. GDP grew by 370%. What caused such asymmetrical movements between general stock market and whole GDP? Answer lies in interest rates  Picture 

https://advisor.visualcapitalist.com/us-interest-rates/ 

  During the period of 1960-1980 **10year treasury yield** went from 4% to staggering 15% by 1980. To put things into perspective let’s talk in pre-tax terms suppose you’ve bought:

$1M worth of bonds paying you 10% annually.

this means every year you are producing $100.000 pre-tax which is really good. Now let’s say that you want to buy a *business* that’s earning $100.000 pre-tax what is the amount you are willing to pay? well that depends our bond which is virtually risk-free yields 10% return every year for the next 10yrs in pre-tax terms, 

if considering buying a business paying more than 1Million won’t be an intelligent thing to do say you buy a business worth 1.5M making 100k pre-tax the return would be 6.7%. making an investment decision investor is better off with bonds in given example than he is with given business. Not many businesses can return say 10-15% annually for span of 8-10yrs. in period of 1980’s bonds were superior pick as compared to stocks.

As said inflation causes interest rates to move higher and this leads us to market sentiment swaying away from stocks to fixed investments paying higher yield. And vice versa as Warren Buffett said ‘’the effect of interest rate changes is usually obscured. Nonetheless, the effect--like the invisible pull of gravity--is constantly there’’. 

  Since we established the basic frame in which this letter is written, now let’s get back to burry

As we said raising inflation causes interest rates to go up and stock prices to go down, some companies have high exposure to inflation and some don’t. by  experience and many examples we know that inflation hurts growth stocks more than their older peers why? Most of the time high growth tech companies are trading based on future performance, valuations are based on revenue multiples and sizes of the enterprise, newly baked companies don’t produce any free cash flow. this type of environment is sustainable at low interest rates since everyone is better of buying a speculative security $XYZ for price of say 50$ that has high trading volume that is likely trade at 100$ in this type of environment high growths are simply better performing group than older peers and fixed investments. 

What happens when there are risks of inflation kicking in? well most likely general public will shift their attention to ‘safer’’ securities that have less **exposure to inflation risks** case can be made for companies that have pricing power to delegate rising costs by raising prices (mature companies for example) or fixed investment securities.  We can argue that there are other hedges against inflation but are more suited for sophisticated individual

As of June5, 2021 what’s the big picture? Inflation could be both transitory or here to stay I don’t think Its in my competence to guess the macro environment and therefore I won’t. 

As described earlier inflation followed by higher interest rates causes the general public to shift from high growth stocks to safer investments, this has double effect ‘’safer’’ company stock prices are on the rise and growth companies with unsustainable multiples and add public opinion shifting away from the business given securities price tends to go down. 
reason is growth companies are more dependent on borrowing money to fuel growth, and higher interest rates make that more expensive leading to slower growth and the possibility of those large borrowings crushing their business.

In case of Michael burry and his conviction about upcoming inflation mixed with bearish view on TESLA explains his move. As we know betting against Tesla in 2020wasn’t a smart move to make(source S3) 

  [https://imgur.com/EW5ydel](https://imgur.com/EW5ydel)

Tesla short sellers lost about $40Billion dollars in 2020 so betting against it just because it trades at high multiples or is cash low negative isn’t a sufficient argument to bet against it there *should be more factors interacting with each other in order to bet against Tesla.  As of 2021 we have the following picture* 

**Almost unjustifiable trading multiples, Internal company problems such as supply-chain issues, accompanied by China operations pressures, in mix with external factor of inflation followed up by rising bond yields makes the company somewhat vulnerable as compared to previous year.**

Hello again, everyone.

After my [analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/nhhov7/cruise_ship_stocks_fundamental_comps_analysis/) of cruise ship stocks, it was refreshing to pour through companies with such strong financials. However, with healthy income statements and balance sheets come high, perhaps overly optimistic valuations. I expected that the stock price of most of these companies would be completely divorced from their near-future expected financials, and I was mostly correct, but there are still a couple of buying opportunities I am excited to share.

After analyzing a list of some of the strongest e-commerce players in the world, I found 2 companies where I believed there is a value opportunity: Alibaba and eBay.

I had expected any Alibaba buying opportunity to have been completely swallowed given that every analysis, comment, and post I see about the stock is centered around how now is a great time to buy and how many institutions are buying, but the stock is still at a level where I would consider buying.

The opportunity which suits me and my portfolio better, and the one which I have provided some additional DD on is, eBay. I won't spoil too much, but I was really excited to dive into this company, and everything I found made me lean more into buying. I was able to discover what I consider to be compelling evidence that the company is undervalued, why the stock is undervalued, and reason to believe that the price will rise to fair value in the near-term. I made a purchase of eBay stock after my research, and I do not own any of the other companies listed. I purchased the stock at the beginning of the week, and it has had a fortunate run-up since then, but the difference between the price today and my fair value estimate, $65 -&gt; $71 does not hit as hard as $60 -&gt;71.

A quick note on my DD. I don't often put this sort of research down on paper, so this is halfway (at most) between a competent report and stream-of-consciousness research. If I wanted to look into something, I went and did it, then took down the notes and worried about formatting almost not at all. If anything is unclear, spelled wrong, or doesn't make sense, let me know and I'll go edit. I did some editing of course, but I might've missed something!

**Model**

[**https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12kNprSoMUKCrM3tVNAaXkKmih45SGD7LuQdM2y2SieY/edit?usp=sharing**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12kNprSoMUKCrM3tVNAaXkKmih45SGD7LuQdM2y2SieY/edit?usp=sharing)

**My Due Diligence on eBay**

[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S8SRRHtQ4HTdZydy83yYbz-b1CqNUeqiVJObXIawIKQ/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S8SRRHtQ4HTdZydy83yYbz-b1CqNUeqiVJObXIawIKQ/edit?usp=sharing)

**Methodology**:

* Created a three-statement model for Alibaba Group Holding Limited, Shopify Inc., Amazon. com Inc., JD .com Inc., Sea Limited, MercadoLibre Inc., eBay Inc., and Walmart Inc.,
* Combined these with a WACC build-up to create an unlevered DCF and derived a fair-value-per-share estimate using a growth in perpetuity and an exit EBITDA multiple approach
* Spread comparable companies (the companies listeD)
* Combined results from DCF and select comps valuations to arrive at fair value estimates

**How to use the model**

* Anywhere you see blue text is OK to edit, and should not result in breaking anything. Green text = taken from another worksheet, so if you want to change one of those cells I recommend following the trail first
* To make meaningful changes to the 3-statement-model, scroll to the bottom of each ""Financials"" page to tweak assumptions about revenue growth, GPM, and other assumptions. You can also adjust the specifics for each case scenario from here
* I have tried to supply useful assumptions about terminal growth rates and exit EBITDA multiples in the DCF models. Feel free to adjust as needed, keeping in mind the model is very sensitive to these inputs
* WACC buildup can be done however you want. If you have access to a Bloomberg terminal you can get a better adjusted beta than I used, and a more precise cost of debt (more on that below), or you can just use the override cell to put in a WACC% directly
* Trading Comps Input essentially works to arrive at normalized multiples before converting to an output. Do not be intimidated by non-Gaap disclosures. Everything here is available on annual reports, quarterly reports, and press releases.
* For trading comps outputs, simply toggle the companies in column B until you have the company you wish to analyze in the first position, and the other comps below it, then head to Valuation Matrix to see the results.
* Feel free to adjust the assumptions, there are a lot of them
* If you can think of an assumption better than something I have here, or if you spot a mistake let me know!

**Other Notes:**

* Some of these companies have assumptions that I have baked in which should be scrutinized. I would highly recommend against jumping straight to the DCF/val matrix and instead take some time to adjust the assumptions. You may not agree with my findings and theses (plural for thesis?) so play safe!
* The 2 irl people I showed my work to asked me to rank the companies in order of which stocks I like the most. For me, the value-based &amp; forward-looking rankings are 1. EBAY 2. BABA 3.AMZN 4. WMT 5. SHOP 6. JD 7. SE 8. MELI
* JMIA was considered for the list, but the financials the company publishes are lacking in depth, and I get a little squeamish when a company has ""technologies"" in its name, so I let it go. Jumia is a very interesting company though, worth looking into if you're not afraid of some sovereign/political risk.
* MELI appears to have a shorter payables turnover than receivables. Thumbs down.
* I Imported the model from excel to Google Sheets before sharing, so if something is broken, let me know so I can go in and fix it ASAP
* Used 10Y YTM bond data on FINRA when possible to arrive at assumptions for cost-of-debt used in WACC build-up. If you have access to a bloomberg terminal you can grab the bond with the best volume and use that.
* I apologize for ambiguity (especially on the non-gaap stuff) but I couldn't figure out how to remove my name from the comments quickly (if you know how to do this, other than going one-by-one through each comment, let me know and I'll reupload). Most comments were simply memos to myself to remember what each cell consists of beyond the label (i.e., components of ""other current assets"")
* A thousand more things. If you want to know just ask.

Source:  [https://behavioralvalueinvestor.com/blog/2019/5/14/5-insights-from-the-2019-berkshire-hathaway-annual-meeting](https://behavioralvalueinvestor.com/blog/2019/5/14/5-insights-from-the-2019-berkshire-hathaway-annual-meeting)

Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger provided many insights when they answered questions for nearly 6 hours on Saturday, May 4th, during the 2019 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting. The following 5 themes stood out as the most important for investors:

**1.    Meaning of Value Investing**

***Warren Buffett:*** *The decision to buy Amazon’s stock was just as much based on value investing principles as a decision to buy a statistically cheap stock. Value investing is about estimating and valuing future cash flows, not about how low a Price to Book or a Price to Earnings ratio is for a stock.*

***Warren Buffett:*** *You can pay too much for a wonderful business. There is a price where we could have paid too much for See’s Candies and it wouldn’t have worked out well as an investment. You can turn any investment into a bad deal by paying too much. What you can’t do is turn any investment into a good deal by paying a cheap price.*

***Warren Buffett:*** *We are comfortable holding a lot of cash because we are operating on the assumption that we will have an opportunity to deploy it at very attractive rates.*

***Charlie Munger****: Our problem in finding investments is that people are willing to pay higher prices than we are.* 

***Warren Buffett:*** *We could invest $100B in the next year, just not at the prices that we like. It is not in the interest of shareholders that we start behaving like everybody else.*

Buffett’s disclosure that one of his two investing lieutenants bought Amazon’s stock in his portion of Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio shortly prior to the annual meeting was perhaps the biggest piece of news. Yet as far as we can tell from Buffett’s answers, he did not choose to do the same with the much larger pool of capital that he manages for Berkshire.

The investing community has been having this debate for some time – does evolving mean starting to invest in high-expectation stocks of high quality, fast-growing companies? Or does it mean sticking to the tried and true approach of waiting for investments where the expectations embedded in the price are very pessimistic?

Buffett correctly points out that [value investing](https://youtu.be/wIKEcpL6Xv0) is defined by estimating the *intrinsic value* of a business based on its assets and future cash flows and buying it with a big *margin of safety* relative to that value. That means that it can be completely consistent with value investing principles to invest in a stock with a high Price to Earnings ratio if one thinks that the value is much higher.

However, **the higher the embedded expectations the more confident one has to be about the distant future of a business.** Few businesses possess such predictability and few investors are so good as to have such long-term foresight about far-out business results. Buffett also reminded us that no matter how good a business is, there is a price at which it will make a poor investment. It seems like this is a fact that has been forgotten as more and more investors succumb to Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO) and fancy themselves such great business forecasters that they consider the price paid for their investments to be of only secondary importance. 

Keep in mind that **we are deep into a bull market, with high valuations and few bargains.** Maybe you are one of the select few who can pay high valuations for stocks and still generate good returns based on your amazing business judgement. However, far more think that they can do this than actually can. Those who are not self-aware enough to stay within their [circle of competence](https://behavioralvalueinvestor.com/blog/2018/9/30/circle-of-competence) are bound to lose a lot of money.

As far as we know, Buffett and Munger have not changed their stripes – [they are keeping a lot of cash on the sidelines and choosing to wait for genuine bargains](https://behavioralvalueinvestor.com/blog/2017/7/18/the-low-cost-of-inaction-dont-just-do-something-stand-there). The recently announced deal by Berkshire to finance Occidental Petroleum’s acquisition by buying an 8% Preferred Stock and a Warrant that will allow Berkshire to participate in the upside suggests that Buffett is far more eager to get a high-probability low-teens rate of return than to imagine himself capable of figuring out Amazon’s future in 20 years. 

***Charlie Munger:*** *You don't need a portfolio of 50 stocks if you know what you are doing.*

***Charlie Munger****: If I took the 30 biggest transactions out of Berkshire \[in the past\] 60 years, what would Berkshire be? Not much. I mean we wouldn't be poor, but we wouldn't be rich either. Maybe once every two years we had a major opportunity. Not very many. (2)*

***Warren Buffett****: We do not have any formula that calculates risk. We do our own calculation of risk vs. reward in every investment. ... We do not think that the results would be changed favorably by having lots of committees and lots of spreadsheets. ... The first question we ask is: ""Are we reasonably sure we know what we are doing?""* 

There are two important and related insights here: you need to be very sure you know what you are investing in well and that you do not need to have many good investments to succeed. Most of the investment management industry is over diversified not out of an abundance of insight, but out of a combination of not having enough confidence in the insights they do have and a desire to hedge their business risk. 

Don’t confuse *conventional* with *conservative* – conservative investing means having a high degree of confidence in your estimate of business value and then waiting for a very large gap between price and value to obtain a sufficient margin of safety. Almost by definition, you [aren’t going to find too many investments that fit these criteria](https://behavioralvalueinvestor.com/blog/2018/4/26/portfolio-concentration-how-much-is-optimal) most of the time, so you need to make the ones that you do find count. Or you can do what many others do in investing – make your portfolio look very “safe” by loading up on so many large, well-known companies regardless of price that your returns almost mathematically cannot deviate from the market by too much in either direction. (Hint: For those contemplating the latter approach, save yourself the trouble and [consider a broad low-cost index fund instead](https://behavioralvalueinvestor.com/blog/2017/1/12/passive-investing-is-an-excellent-default-choice-an-active-investors-view)).

**2.    Nature of Business Quality**

***Charlie Munger:*** *If you take the hundred biggest corporations in the United States in, say, 1900, there is exactly one left alive \[among the list of today's 100 biggest\]. But that \[turnover on the list\] didn't happen because everything got weak. It happened because the competition and the change got so strong. (2)*

***Warren Buffett:*** *It is possible that the new technology platform companies will prove to have durable moats, but we have had trouble thinking through their future economics. We can understand their business now, but less so how they will evolve. We have tried to mitigate that by hiring people who understand these business models better, like Ted and Todd, and by trying to widen our circle of competence. However, we are very comfortable missing out on big returns as long as we have a good batting average on the investments that we do make.*

***Warren Buffett:*** *Brands and retailers have always struggled for who has the upper hand. Recently the power has been shifting in the direction of the retailers like Amazon and Walmart.*

Few companies remain dominant forever. You can think back to almost any period in history and find once-dominant businesses that have become greatly diminished over time. Kodak. Dell. Yahoo. Sears. [General Electric](https://behavioralvalueinvestor.com/blog/2018/11/14/dont-make-these-5-investing-mistakes-that-general-electric-investors-made). The interesting thing is that few would have been able to point to exactly what was going to cause these companies to become less relevant in advance. At the time it frequently seems like some of these businesses are unstoppable. 

And yet most companies have been stopped or at least severely challenged. You have to allow for unknown unknowns – whether it be technological change, regulation or changing consumer preferences. Studying a business’s history is just the first step in [company analysis and valuation](https://youtu.be/wIKEcpL6Xv0) – you then need to think through how things can change, and what factors have already started to deviate from the past. 

In the last two decades the pace of change has accelerated, and the durability of companies’ competitive advantages has diminished. So you should be on guard against paying too much for seemingly entrenched companies and seek investment opportunities where there is plenty of margin of safety for the future to looks somewhat worse than the past and for you to still generate an attractive rate of return on your investment.

**3.    Rationality vs. Behavioral Biases**

***Charlie Munger:*** *It's hard to be reasonable. There are a million tricks the human mind plays on its owner. That's what causes stupidity. Think of how many times you've said to yourself, 'Why in the hell did I do that?' (2)*

***Charlie Munger:*** *People who say they are rational \[should\] know how things work, what works and what doesn't, and why. That's rationality. It doesn't help if you just know what's worked before, because if you know why, then you'll be better at it (2)*

***Charlie Munger:*** *Both Warren and I feel it's our moral duty to be as rational as we can possibly be. A lot of people who are brilliant in some ways tend to make these utterly asinine decisions in other ways. We both tend to collect the asininities of the world in a kind of checklist. And we try to avoid everything on the checklist. (2)*

Three ideas here for you to consider to make better decisions:

1. We are all biased, but we can be more rational if we [systematically defend against behavioral biases](https://behavioralvalueinvestor.com/blog/2017/1/30/behavioral-defense-in-decision-making)
2. Having a high IQ is not enough to be a good investor, and it can be especially dangerous if it leads to overconfidence (e.g. Long Term Capital Management)
3. You can, and should [use checklists](https://behavioralvalueinvestor.com/blog/2018/7/29/the-skeptics-checklist) to improve your decision making process. Focus on those things that have had a bad track record of working and avoid doing them.

**4. Business of Investment Management**

***Warren Buffett:*** *You should only invest other people’s money if you can have the kind of investors who will stick with you for the long term and not panic and withdraw funds during rough patches in the market.*

***Charlie Munger:*** *People come out of the womb with the delayed gratification skill - we can’t teach it, we pick the people who have it.*

***Warren Buffett:*** *You can invest small sums at much higher rates of return than you can large sums.*

***Charlie Munger:*** *I have seen genius after genius with a good record, and pretty soon they have 30B under management and 2 floors of young men working for them. And away goes the good record.*

You cannot [invest for the long-term](https://behavioralvalueinvestor.com/blog/2017/3/22/how-and-why-to-be-a-long-term-investor) if your investors have a short-term time horizon. So if you have no idea who your investors are and you sell your services based on short-term performance – guess what? You can talk about being a long-term investor all you want, but in practice you will not be able to actually invest for the long-term if you hit a rough patch, which most investors will.

The investment management business is the ultimate scale business. Costs are largely fixed, profitability sky-rockets as assets under management grow. I have met very few investors willing to limit the size of their assets so as to maximize the outcome for their investors rather than for themselves.

For some it’s just blatant greed and not caring about their clients’ outcomes too much. However, I believe that there are many professional investors who do care, but somehow convince themselves that they are immune from the force of gravity that sucks out excess returns once assets grow to be too large that they know affects peers. Maybe they tell themselves that they hired a few new analysts, and that will offset the burden of the larger asset base. Or perhaps they figured out a new strategy to launch alongside with the original. Don’t kid yourselves – for most investing approaches, and especially for fundamental equity investing, managing many billions of dollars is not in your original clients’ best interest.

**5.  How to Learn and Evolve**

**Warren Buffett:** *You should expand your circle of competence if you can. I have expanded mine a little over time. But you should be pretty cautious.*

***Warren Buffett:*** *If you want to grow your investment circle of competence you want to read a lot and study a lot of businesses. It is more competitive now than it was when we started investing, but if you build your circle and have the discipline to be patient and do nothing a lot of the time you can still do well.*

***Charlie Munger:*** *It is amazing how much we learned over the years. If we hadn't the results wouldn't have been anywhere near as good. We needed to improve at each step to take it to a new level.*

Buffett is the world’s most successful investor in large part because he was able to [evolve his investing process](https://behavioralvalueinvestor.com/blog/2018/12/13/what-you-can-learn-from-how-warren-buffetts-investment-process-evolved) where most other would have rested on their laurels and stagnated. It is incredibly humbling to see how these two people, the youngest of whom is well into his 80s, challenge themselves to learn and evolve even today. It is this unquenchable thirst to learn and expand their [circle of competence](https://behavioralvalueinvestor.com/blog/2018/9/30/circle-of-competence) that makes Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger so amazing. While there are many things about them which many of us will not be able to replicate, learning [how to become the best investor that you can be](https://behavioralvalueinvestor.com/blog/bestinvestingbooks) is something that we can and should all strive for.",t2_13yll7,False,,0,False,5 Insights From The 2019 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting,[],r/ValueInvesting,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_nswe3v,False,dark,0.96,,public,90,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Buffett,False,90,,False,True,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1622930508.0,text,6,,,text,self.ValueInvesting,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey, guys.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.    Nature of Business Quality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Charlie Munger:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;If you take the hundred biggest corporations in the United States in, say, 1900, there is exactly one left alive [among the list of today&amp;#39;s 100 biggest]. But that [turnover on the list] didn&amp;#39;t happen because everything got weak.

We can understand their business now, but less so how they will evolve. We have tried to mitigate that by hiring people who understand these business models better, like Ted and Todd, and by trying to widen our circle of competence. However, we are very comfortable missing out on big returns as long as we have a good batting average on the investments that we do make.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warren Buffett:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Brands and retailers have always struggled for who has the upper hand. Recently the power has been shifting in the direction of the retailers like Amazon and Walmart.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few companies remain dominant forever. You can think back to almost any period in history and find once-dominant businesses that have become greatly diminished over time. Kodak. Dell. Yahoo. Sears. &lt;a href=""https://behavioralvalueinvestor.com/blog/2018/11/14/dont-make-these-5-investing-mistakes-that-general-electric-investors-made""&gt;General Electric&lt;/a&gt;. The interesting thing is that few would have been able to point to exactly what was going to cause these companies to become less relevant in advance. At the time it frequently seems like some of these businesses are unstoppable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet most companies have been stopped or at least severely challenged. You have to allow for unknown unknowns – whether it be technological change, regulation or changing consumer preferences. Studying a business’s history is just the first step in &lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/wIKEcpL6Xv0""&gt;company analysis and valuation&lt;/a&gt; – you then need to think through how things can change, and what factors have already started to deviate from the past. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last two decades the pace of change has accelerated, and the durability of companies’ competitive advantages has diminished. So you should be on guard against paying too much for seemingly entrenched companies and seek investment opportunities where there is plenty of margin of safety for the future to looks somewhat worse than the past and for you to still generate an attractive rate of return on your investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.    Rationality vs. Behavioral Biases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Charlie Munger:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;It&amp;#39;s hard to be reasonable. There are a million tricks the human mind plays on its owner. That&amp;#39;s what causes stupidity. Think of how many times you&amp;#39;ve said to yourself, &amp;#39;Why in the hell did I do that?&amp;#39; (2)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Charlie Munger:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;People who say they are rational [should] know how things work, what works and what doesn&amp;#39;t, and why. That&amp;#39;s rationality. It doesn&amp;#39;t help if you just know what&amp;#39;s worked before, because if you know why, then you&amp;#39;ll be better at it (2)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Charlie Munger:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Both Warren and I feel it&amp;#39;s our moral duty to be as rational as we can possibly be. A lot of people who are brilliant in some ways tend to make these utterly asinine decisions in other ways. We both tend to collect the asininities of the world in a kind of checklist. And we try to avoid everything on the checklist. (2)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three ideas here for you to consider to make better decisions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are all biased, but we can be more rational if we &lt;a href=""https://behavioralvalueinvestor.com/blog/2017/1/30/behavioral-defense-in-decision-making""&gt;systematically defend against behavioral biases&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having a high IQ is not enough to be a good investor, and it can be especially dangerous if it leads to overconfidence (e.g. Long Term Capital Management)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can, and should &lt;a href=""https://behavioralvalueinvestor.com/blog/2018/7/29/the-skeptics-checklist""&gt;use checklists&lt;/a&gt; to improve your decision making process. Focus on those things that have had a bad track record of working and avoid doing them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Business of Investment Management&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warren Buffett:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;You should only invest other people’s money if you can have the kind of investors who will stick with you for the long term and not panic and withdraw funds during rough patches in the market.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Charlie Munger:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;People come out of the womb with the delayed gratification skill - we can’t teach it, we pick the people who have it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warren Buffett:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;You can invest small sums at much higher rates of return than you can large sums.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Charlie Munger:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;I have seen genius after genius with a good record, and pretty soon they have 30B under management and 2 floors of young men working for them. And away goes the good record.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You cannot &lt;a href=""https://behavioralvalueinvestor.com/blog/2017/3/22/how-and-why-to-be-a-long-term-investor""&gt;invest for the long-term&lt;/a&gt; if your investors have a short-term time horizon. So if you have no idea who your investors are and you sell your services based on short-term performance – guess what? You can talk about being a long-term investor all you want, but in practice you will not be able to actually invest for the long-term if you hit a rough patch, which most investors will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The investment management business is the ultimate scale business. Costs are largely fixed, profitability sky-rockets as assets under management grow. I have met very few investors willing to limit the size of their assets so as to maximize the outcome for their investors rather than for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some it’s just blatant greed and not caring about their clients’ outcomes too much. However, I believe that there are many professional investors who do care, but somehow convince themselves that they are immune from the force of gravity that sucks out excess returns once assets grow to be too large that they know affects peers. Maybe they tell themselves that they hired a few new analysts, and that will offset the burden of the larger asset base. Or perhaps they figured out a new strategy to launch alongside with the original. Don’t kid yourselves – for most investing approaches, and especially for fundamental equity investing, managing many billions of dollars is not in your original clients’ best interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5.  How to Learn and Evolve&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warren Buffett:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;You should expand your circle of competence if you can. I have expanded mine a little over time. But you should be pretty cautious.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warren Buffett:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;If you want to grow your investment circle of competence you want to read a lot and study a lot of businesses. It is more competitive now than it was when we started investing, but if you build your circle and have the discipline to be patient and do nothing a lot of the time you can still do well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Charlie Munger:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;It is amazing how much we learned over the years. If we hadn&amp;#39;t the results wouldn&amp;#39;t have been anywhere near as good. We needed to improve at each step to take it to a new level.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buffett is the world’s most successful investor in large part because he was able to &lt;a href=""https://behavioralvalueinvestor.com/blog/2018/12/13/what-you-can-learn-from-how-warren-buffetts-investment-process-evolved""&gt;evolve his investing process&lt;/a&gt; where most other would have rested on their laurels and stagnated. It is incredibly humbling to see how these two people, the youngest of whom is well into his 80s, challenge themselves to learn and evolve even today. It is this unquenchable thirst to learn and expand their &lt;a href=""https://behavioralvalueinvestor.com/blog/2018/9/30/circle-of-competence""&gt;circle of competence&lt;/a&gt; that makes Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger so amazing. While there are many things about them which many of us will not be able to replicate, learning &lt;a href=""https://behavioralvalueinvestor.com/blog/bestinvestingbooks""&gt;how to become the best investor that you can be&lt;/a&gt; is something that we can and should all strive for.&lt;/p&gt;

Hello, I am 13 and just performed my first DCF calculation and would like feedback.

First I found 2019 and 2020 FCF numbers online. 

Then I found FCF/Net income, which was an average of 1.19. I multiplied this number by Yahoo Finance's net income estimates in 2021 and 2022 to get my FCF estimates for those years, with 2022E FCF being  $13,568,000.

I searched up ADBE's WACC and got 7.54%, which I used for the required return. My perpetual growth rate of 2.5% is close to the economy as a whole. 

I found terminal value using  $13,568,000(1+0.025) / 0.0754-0.025 to get  $275,936,507. 

My discount factor was (1+0.0754)\^t, where t = 1,2,3 depending on if it's for 2021, 2022, or the terminal value respectively. I divided FCF estimates by the discount factors to get PV of future FCF values, which I then added up and divided by the 435,000 (in thousands) shares outstanding to get a fair value of $435 a share. 

Adobe is currently trading at $504 a share, so it seems to be modestly overvalued. I'm not surprised, because it's an awesome company. 

I would like to know what values you folk got for ADBE and whether I made any mistakes.

232,,ValueInvesting,"Is anyone else highly interested in $BTI (British American Tobacco) right now?   
Tobacco company with strong fundamentals and real growth channels in ecigs/vaping/oral products.  The stock has only traded this cheap for 1-2% of it's history, despite any evidence of a slowdown in the industry.   


\*Very\* quick thesis:

**Bull:**

1. **Priced for earnings compression despite earnings growth**: Trading at a 10x PE/8% div yield all while growing earnings 10% annually, &amp; dividends 8.2% annually, from 2016-2020.
2. **Growth/new vectors:** Management has signaled 7-9% long term growth - 4% sales growth and 8% EPS growth - driven by tailwinds in new categories - vaping/ non combustible products.

**Bear:**

1. Obviously a tobacco company &amp; people are leery to invest in the space. Shockingly, has an above average ESG rating determined by largest ratings companies.(62.5% percentile).
2. ESG flows. ESG is the wave now, that's where money is flowing, and that's likely to be the case moving forward. Not much more to say here. Cash matters more than sentiment in the long run. While ESG is hot now, human nature hasn't changed and we still have our vices. 

Essentially, this stock can stay at low valuations and investors can still earn a healthy return. It's priced at its floor. Multiple expansion would be even better of course, it would likely be driven by a cool-down in ESG, which is unlikely.

Tobacco company with strong fundamentals and real growth channels in ecigs/vaping/oral products.  The stock has only traded this cheap for 1-2% of it&amp;#39;s history, despite any evidence of a slowdown in the industry.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Very* quick thesis:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bull:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Priced for earnings compression despite earnings growth&lt;/strong&gt;: Trading at a 10x PE/8% div yield all while growing earnings 10% annually, &amp;amp; dividends 8.2% annually, from 2016-2020.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Growth/new vectors:&lt;/strong&gt; Management has signaled 7-9% long term growth - 4% sales growth and 8% EPS growth - driven by tailwinds in new categories - vaping/ non combustible products.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bear:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obviously a tobacco company &amp;amp; people are leery to invest in the space. Shockingly, has an above average ESG rating determined by largest ratings companies.(62.5% percentile).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ESG flows. ESG is the wave now, that&amp;#39;s where money is flowing, and that&amp;#39;s likely to be the case moving forward. Not much more to say here. Cash matters more than sentiment in the long run. While ESG is hot now, human nature hasn&amp;#39;t changed and we still have our vices. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially, this stock can stay at low valuations and investors can still earn a healthy return. It&amp;#39;s priced at its floor. Multiple expansion would be even better of course, it would likely be driven by a cool-down in ESG, which is unlikely. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What am I missing? Anyone else love the idea of this stock? Anyone hate it? Let&amp;#39;s talk through it.&lt;/p&gt;

240,,ValueInvesting,"For the past year, I've wanted to create a small group to bring together a diverse group of people who consider themselves apprentices of value investing. The aim of the group would be up to the people who are interested, but I have several ideas:

1) A monthly book that we not only read, but dissect chapter by chapter for understanding. This could be done in a shared Google Sheet for past reference. Having cliff note versions of books such as Margin of Safety (Klarman), Security Analysis/Intelligent Investor (Graham), Fisher, the Buffett Letters, etc. has the potential to be an incredible piece of IP. It would also allow for questions to be asked regarding difficult-to-understand topics that could serve as jump-off points for further conversation.

2) A safe place to practice systematic due diligence and idea generation that can be critiqued by peers. While I love Reddit, I often wish for more depth in discourse in a community where the people come to know one another, if only by screen name.

The aim of the group would be up to the people who are interested, but I have several ideas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) A monthly book that we not only read, but dissect chapter by chapter for understanding. This could be done in a shared Google Sheet for past reference. Having cliff note versions of books such as Margin of Safety (Klarman), Security Analysis/Intelligent Investor (Graham), Fisher, the Buffett Letters, etc. has the potential to be an incredible piece of IP. It would also allow for questions to be asked regarding difficult-to-understand topics that could serve as jump-off points for further conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) A safe place to practice systematic due diligence and idea generation that can be critiqued by peers. While I love Reddit, I often wish for more depth in discourse in a community where the people come to know one another, if only by screen name. Furthermore, it would be a nice way to limit the people we see on multiple investing subreddits who are assumed to be pumping stocks.

254,,ValueInvesting,"After reading books about value investing, watching youtube tutorials about DCF, reading financial blogs… I wonder how to screen value or quality companies. 

Once I tried a very simple screening filter using Refinitiv: Market Cap &gt; Cash and Equivalents

It is a funny world and must be a broken market in which you have 1,134 companies with more cash sitting on their balance sheets than they are valued in the market. So, by buying a share, simply phrased, I buy their cash and get assets, intangible assets, know how, patents, employees, marketing and sales network, brand…for free. Unfortunately, my broker does not list even a fraction of those companies, since they are headquartered in China, Japan, India, South America…

So, I used finviz and played with the stock screener. Unfortunately, there is no condition filter like Market Cap &gt; Cash and Equivalents.

Instead, I played around and tried some other conditions which reduced the investment universe massively. Of course, I will still conduct a DD of a company after screening, BUT I wonder which screening filters would you use? 

For example, in the fundamentals tab, I only used 5 parameters. I left out the market cap as well as the dividend yield in the descriptive tab. 

[Finviz Settings](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=111&amp;f=fa_grossmargin_o20,fa_pb_low,fa_pe_u10,fa_ps_u2,fa_quickratio_o1&amp;ft=2)

**Some Basic Information**

* Rite Aid has only 55 million shares outstanding. Of those, approximately 57.75% are held by institutions and insiders.
* There are 7,860,000 million shares short or about 14.3% of the total outstanding shares. Those familiar with RAD know that it has been a target of short sellers for years who have tried desperately (but failed) to push the company into bankruptcy.
* The company had annual revenue of $24 Billion last year and is projected to hit $25 Billion this year.
* Despite having $24 - $25 Billion in annual revenue, Rite Aid's market cap is barely above $1 Billion.
* The stock price broke above $20 per share on June 2, 2021. The 2021 high share price thus far is $32.48, achieved back in January.
* The company is expected to turn the corner this year and report positive net earnings for the full fiscal year.
* The long-term debt is approximately $3.1 Billion
* Rite Aid achieved positive free cash flow last year and will do so again this year.
* Earlier this year, RAD completed an acquisition of Bartell Drugs for just under $100 Million, making Rite Aid the #1 pharmacy in Seattle.
* Rite Aid is the #3 retail pharmacy in the USA behind CVS and Walgreens.
* In 2018, Walgreens acquired 1,923 Rite Aid stores for $4.4 billion in cash. Rite Aid now has more than 2,500 retail stores today.
* Some analysis done on Rite Aid has projected that the breakup value of the company is in the range of $39 - $50 per share.

**Impact of Coronavirus Vaccination Program and Future Contribution of Other Vaccines**

One significant contributor to Rite Aid’s financial improvement on the current fiscal year results will be the coronavirus vaccine distribution program. Rite Aid is an official participant in the US government’s Federal Retail Pharmacy Program for COVID-19 Vaccination. The US government dramatically increased the reimbursement rates for pharmacies administering the coronavirus vaccine to $40 from $28 for a single dose.

At the rate of vaccination projected, it is fair to estimate that Rite Aid will administer approximately six (6) million doses of COVID-19 vaccine during the first half of its 2022 fiscal year alone. Using the government reimbursement rates, the six (6) million doses will likely generate $230 million in revenue for Rite Aid and contribute approximately $2 per share in net profits. While the initial vaccination program will likely be completed during Rite Aid’s fiscal first half, the COVID-19 vaccine boosters are likely to become an annual revenue / profit stream for Rite Aid, as the annual flu vaccine is today. The latest view from epidemiologists suggests that annual coronavirus booster shots will likely be required on an annual basis. The global spread of coronavirus variants such as the E484K mutation lend credence to this view. Furthermore, customers visiting their local Rite Aid for COVID-19 vaccinations and boosters will become aware and take advantage of the fact that the retailer also offers nineteen (19) other vaccines, including flu, pneumonia, chicken pox, HPV, hepatitis A &amp; B, and meningitis among others. As a result, vaccine distribution will continue to play a role in Rite Aids retail pharmacy growth story.

Finally, with the rapid development of mRNA vaccine technology to address the COVID-19 pandemic, we can expect to see new vaccines hit the market to prevent a variety of different types of cancers and other life-threatenting / chronic diseases. Such vaccines would be added to the list administered by pharmacists at local retail stores such as Rite Aid, increasing the revenue and profit potential of such establishments.

**Potential for RAD to Be Acquired**

While Amazon is often mentioned as a suitor for Rite Aid, I actually believe that the highest probability of a buyout of Rite Aid would come from Walmart.

Walmart is already a leading player in the retail pharmacy / prescription drug segment, and the category is a strategic growth target for the company. However, Walmart has nowhere near the presence in the pharmacy sector of either CVS or Walgreens. In order for Walmart to become competitive in this space, they have to increase their size and scale. If Walmart let's Amazon step up and become the third largest player in retail pharmacy, it's game over. WMT needs to move into this third position and block AMZN from doing so.

A couple of the benefits of Walmart acquiring Rite Aid would be:

* Walmart would have double the purchasing power for prescriptions thereby lowering its overall drug cost, improving profitability
* All the goods sold in the front-end of the 2,500+ Rite Aid retail pharmacies are the same products Walmart sells in its own department stores. Once again, when you buy larger quantities you get lower prices. This is a fact of the business world that I know first hand.

Based on the above 2 points, Walmart would improve both its own existing margins and at the same time would improve those of the Rite Aid revenue through such an acquisition.

The Rite Aid PBM would help Walmart to capture much greater market share in the prescription market, thereby enhaning those gains even further.

If you look at Walgreens and CVS when they had approximately $25 - $30 billion in revenue, they were earning about $4 - 6 billion per year. Therefore, considering Walmarts expertise in running brick and mortar establishments, one could make the leap of logic that WMT would achieve similar profit levels. So an acquisition of RAD by Walmart essentially provides a 2-3 year payback on the investment.

That being said, today, June 3, 2021, CFRA Research, an independent research organization, issued its latest report concerning Rite Aid and made the following statement:

***""Amazon is looking to increase its physical drug retail business to compete head on with CVS, Walgreens, and RAD. While this would certainly intensify the competitive landscape, we think it will take AMZN considerable time to compete on the same scale as the incumbents since there are over 20k pharmacies among CVS, WBA, and RAD vs. only 350 Whole Foods locations if AMZN were to start at its grocery stores. It would make more sense for AMZN to acquire a regional drug retailer like RAD to quickly establish a physical presence.""***

And finally, a potential dark horse suitor has emerged...or re-emerged, I should say.

Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. ( WBA ) completed the sale of its Alliance Healthcare businesses to AmerisourceBergen ( ABC ) for $6.5 billion in a cash and stock deal. With that $6.5 billion windfall, Walgreens is now is a position to purchase the remainder of Rite Aid, finally completing the acquisition that it set out to accomplish way back in 2015. Such an acquisition would be a highly strategic move accomplishing the following:

\* Gaining more size and scale, thereby putting WBA in a much more competitive position with CVS

\* Providing Walgreens with a PBM to help it gain share in the prescription drug market and become more competitive in that segment

\* Blocking both Amazon and Walmart from acquiring Rite Aid as part of their pharmacy strategy which would quickly catapult either company into the position of 3rd largest retail pharmacy in the USA

The race appears to be on to see who will ultimately acquire Rite Aid!

**Conclusion - Potential for Share Price to Soar Higher this Summer**

Rite Aid is due to report its Q1 earnings for the current fiscal year on June 24, 2021. I personally believe that the stock is likely to rally back to its 2021 high of $32.48 as that date approaches.

271,,ValueInvesting,"Berkshire has purchased $9.2 billion of Verizon stock over the last 9 months, at an average price of $59. Today VZ trades below $57, giving us an opportunity to follow Berkshire into one of its largest common stock investments at a price below what Berkshire paid

Verizon appears to be a much safer and higher yielding investment than Berkshire itself, with prices where they are. The dividend yield alone is higher than Berkshire's operating earnings yield. Verizon is an example of a stock whose interest rate has NOT collapsed:

https://www.reddit.com/r/brkb/comments/mr2jcp/verizon_a_company_whose_market_value_is_affected/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

I believe Berkshire is fully and optimistically priced right now. Here are my thoughts

**Justification #1:** As a first approximation, Berkshire's operating earnings yield is well below 4%, lower than I've ever seen it. As Buffett explicitly stated at the Annual Meeting, the Q1 2021 earnings were no higher than Q1 2020 would have been without COVID. Berkshire's ""interest rate"" has recently collapsed-- price way up, earnings almost flat

**Justification #2:** Berkshire is fully valued according to a recent and fairly optimistic expert estimate of intrinsic value (Morningstar):

**Justification #3:** Nobody agrees fully with the (book value)+(insurance float) price predictor, but historically, stretching back for decades, it has been a losing proposition to buy above BV+FL. Today BV+FL is $257, and the P/(BV+FL) ratio is 1.13, an extreme high. The last time this happened was in 2014, and you can see what happened then:

**Justification #4:** Berkshire was rapidly tapering its buybacks at $250, far below the current market price of $290. This is a dead giveaway that we are fully valued or overvalued. Berkshire's average buyback price is well below the highest price paid, probably around $210. The buybacks likely target an average price (just like when Berkshire was buying AAPL -- Berkshire bought many shares far above $35 but never made a purchase that would raise the average above $35). Here is the Q1 2021 buyback table, where you can see the tapering:

Today VZ trades below $57, giving us an opportunity to follow Berkshire into one of its largest common stock investments at a price below what Berkshire paid&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verizon appears to be a much safer and higher yielding investment than Berkshire itself, with prices where they are. The dividend yield alone is higher than Berkshire&amp;#39;s operating earnings yield. Verizon is an example of a stock whose interest rate has NOT collapsed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe Berkshire is fully and optimistically priced right now. Here are my thoughts&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Justification #1:&lt;/strong&gt; As a first approximation, Berkshire&amp;#39;s operating earnings yield is well below 4%, lower than I&amp;#39;ve ever seen it. As Buffett explicitly stated at the Annual Meeting, the Q1 2021 earnings were no higher than Q1 2020 would have been without COVID. Berkshire&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;interest rate&amp;quot; has recently collapsed-- price way up, earnings almost flat&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Justification #2:&lt;/strong&gt; Berkshire is fully valued according to a recent and fairly optimistic expert estimate of intrinsic value (Morningstar):&lt;/p&gt;

273,,ValueInvesting,"My question is if its really worth spending several hours to analyse an entire bussines and its potential future growth combined with its current valuation, in order to make a deep and good analysis. That may not sound like much but if you wanna do it great it takes time. Because you really need to understand exactly how the company makes money and its advantages / disadvantages compared to the competitors. Personally this can take several days as I can only do this for a limited time per day.

So, is it worth it when you could instead just make a short valuation analysis on good companies that you believe in (maybe like a 20 min analysis). And then put smaller amounts into each individual stock in order to diversify? By doing this you avoid buying crazily overvalued stocks and you get more time to do other things. And since they say time is money, i am starting to wonder how much time i should spend on analysis of a single company? Basicly, how much do i need to know before i press the buy Button? 

How long do you guys usually take to fully analyse one company?

276,,ValueInvesting,"Hi, I'd like to ask opinions about a quick back of the envelope valuation on Happiness Biotech Group (NASDAQ:HAPP).

# Company

HAPP produces, researches, develops and markets nutraceutical and dietary supplements. Their main line of products revolves around fugi that is supposed to help with different ailments. Honestly, to me this is a bunch of nonsense, but I do recognize that the market for ""alternative medicine"" is huge in china. Most of their operations are China at the moment. I won't dabble too much into my thoughts on the future for this market, expansion opportunities, as I'm no expert in the market. Hence, I'll be looking at any potential growth opportunity as either non-existent or deflationary. 

# Price Floor

Now this is what's interesting about this company, which got me looking into it (Figures in USD). 

1. Cash and cash equivalents:  $ 43,803,000
2. Inventory:  $ 2,127,000
3. PPE:  $ 9,075,000
4. Current long term debt:  $ 2,362,000
5. Current liquidation value of tangible assets (taking inventory at 75% value and PPE at 50% value) minus all debt: $  $ 47,574,000
6. Number of shares:  25900000 
7. **Cash per share: $ 1.69**
8. **Liquidation value per share: $ 1.84**
9. **Current share price: $ 1.75**

# Earnings?

So from a strictly asset play perspective, HAPP doesn't yield enough of a margin of safety to warrant a Graham-type asset investment. The question is then: How much are its earnings worth?

&amp;#x200B;

||2020|2019|2018|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|EPS|0.5|0.75|0.7|
|EBIT| $ 15,532 | $ 21,905 | $ 20,632 |
|EBITA| $ 16,089 | $ 22,542 | $ 20,632 |

Assuming revenue continues to decrease over the next few years we have:

&amp;#x200B;

||1|2|3|4|5...|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|EPS|0.16|0.13|0.1|0.08|...|

NPV of EPS alone (with a 10% discount rate): \~$ 0.53 per share (note how conservative the above numbers are, near a 2/3 reduction from the most recent EPS).

This extremely conservative back of the envelope calculation yields an expected share price of: 1.84 + 0.53 = $ 2.37. A more comprehensive analysis can be seen [here](https://tracktak.com/stock/happ-us/discounted-cash-flow?cagrInYears_1_5=0&amp;ebitTargetMarginInYear_10=0.1225&amp;salesToCapitalRatio=0.43&amp;yearOfConvergence=5).

# Risks

* Company does not seem to define its ""area or expertise"". I see ventures from HAPP in COVID testing ([https://www.reuters.com/article/brief-happiness-biotech-announces-progre/brief-happiness-biotech-announces-progress-of-covid-19-testing-kits-idUSFWN2DW020](https://www.reuters.com/article/brief-happiness-biotech-announces-progre/brief-happiness-biotech-announces-progress-of-covid-19-testing-kits-idUSFWN2DW020)) and it has a wholly owned subsidiary called ""Happy Buy (Fujian)"" in the e-commerce space ([https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1751876/000121390021003606/ea132985-6k\_happiness.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1751876/000121390021003606/ea132985-6k_happiness.htm)). **Both seem like classic scam strategie**s.
* Company is incorporated in the Cayman Islands, with operations in China. US investors are unlikely to have a claim on assets. This may remove the price floor stated above.
* The latest financial figure I was able to get was from mid last year. This was not just from the API that I use, but from the SEC website as well. This seems shady to me, as price at that time-range was much higher and I'd expect more up-to-date financial information.

# My Take

The fundamentals look extremely solid, cash at hand is one of the strongest I've seen recently. FCF is also very strong, but diminishing. The market that the company operates is weird to say the least, incorporation in the Cayman Islands is strange and has me asking many questions. Earnings are relatively strong and even if not, assets should hold value for the stock.

However, I want to get people's thoughts in this. I do get a scammy vibe from this company, but assets/earnings seems almost too strong to let it pass by. What are people's thoughts?

279,,ValueInvesting,"Hi y’all,

So I’ve created two different DCF models in an excel spreadsheet. I use these, along with the Graham intrinsic value formula and an earnings multiplier model, to value / screen prospective investments.

I have a rudimentary idea of how to project future growth (I normally use 1] the lower estimate of analyst growth projections, 2] an average of the growth trend, or 3] something that seems reasonable given market / sector trends). With free cash flow positive companies, I normally can come up with what seems like a reasonable valuation.

However, I’m having trouble using a DCF to value young, often times unprofitable, growth companies (ex. PINS, Z, ETSY, DASH, ABNB, etc.). I don’t quite know how to project changes in operating margin / gross margin / CAPEX, or how to project positive free cash flow when free cash flow is at present negative.

It’s easy to come up with a story that’s great, but hard to find a price tag that makes it worth being a part of (at least with the companies I’ve listed).

What do y’all do to project the things that I’ve listed? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

281,,ValueInvesting,"Tobacco stocks have been Beaton down recently, so I thought it would be a good idea 2 analyze them

Pros: Very high/safe dividends- because these companies don't advertise(it's illegal) and have very consistent customers bc ya know their literally addicted to the companies products, they have lots of cash sitting on the sidelines to pay out in dividends. It's also the only way 2 attract investors because cigarettes aren't exactly seen as a growing trend.

Moat: Lets say your starting a new cigarette company. One question, how do u compete with the big brands (Marlboro, Camel, Lucky strike)? Reality is you can't, because advertising cigarettes are illegal in the west, so you would have to rely on word of mouth witch is pretty unlikely.

Cons: Well to state the obvious they're literally killing their customers, so if you have high moral standards then don't invest(just know any large cap or dividend etf's/indexes definitely hold tobacco stocks- SNP500,vym,schd etc...)

Declining industry- this is actually more complicated than you might think for multiple reasons. 1) in emerging markets(cough cough third world countries) as industrialization occurs and people have more money and they buy cigarettes, also big tobacco is allowed to advertise in a lot of these markets. 2) Big tobacco likes to brag about how their transitioning from cigarettes to alternatives (Vapes, chewing tobacco, weed), this is usually done through Murders and executions with smaller companies.

Regulation/Taxes- In order to dissuade smoking, western governments increase Regulation, and raise taxes. This might stop potential new users(addicts), but when the taxes increase big tobacco also raises the price on their end to increase margin. And of course people who r addicted 2 cigarettes will probably pay whatever price they can get them for.

Now the question is what tobacco company would make a good investment? Well Philip Morris(PM) is internationally focused which should mean they have more potential for growth, and this shows with their stock price trading at a pe of 17. Not exactly overvalued, but for a company with low growth, expected returns will most likely not be very high. Dividend 4.98

Between big tobacco focused on the western markets (MO)Altria and (BTI) British American Tobacco, the better value imo is BTI. The ways these companies try to impress shareholders is to buy cigarette alternatives. MO has the worst track record of overpaying for companies compared 2 BTI(JUUl Kronos). These brands are still a small percentage of these companies portfolios, so betting on which one will dominate the weed business in 20 years is speculation, Although I do believe big tobacco will dominate the weed business bc they're the ones with logistics, money, lobbies, brand consistency, ect... I see BTI as the better by right now as they have a pe of 9.7 dividend of 7.7 compared 2 MO pe 21 div of 6.9. PE obviously isn't the be all end all, but if you compare other metrics you'll probably get my point.

After my research Ive concluded I won't be picking up tobacco stocks anytime soon. While it would make sense for an investror closer to retirement for consistent dividends, my time horizon is pretty long, and I think there's better opportunities out their. If (PM) dropped to about 60 a share I would probably be a player then.

PS- you can still make money on an industry losing value- if a company makes $10 and loses $1 a year, and you pay .50 for it, that's a good deal

288,,ValueInvesting,"I started looking at Lithia Motors ($LAD) last month. They're an automotive retailer here in the states with a Market Cap of $10.37b. They are one of the largest retail dealerships in the US. Their growth is mainly accomplished through M&amp;A of other dealerships.

Fundamental Numbers: 

* Free Cash Flow - went positive for the last 4 years. 
   * They ended 2020 with $381m in FCF. 
   * CAGR on FCF from 2017 to 2020 equaled 86.4%. 
* From 2010 to 2020: 
   * Revenue grew from $2b to $13.1b (CAGR 20.5%).  
   * BVPS CAGR was 24.7% (2020 BVPS of $111.83). 
   * EPS CAGR was 43.7% (2020 EPS of $19.53). 
   * ROE CAGR 19.2% (2020 value was 25.6%) 
* Total Debt in 2020 was $4.175b 
   * Long-term debt was $2.311b 
   * LT Debt to Earnings ratio = 4.92
* Moat / Competitive Advantages:
   * some pricing advantage over smaller competitors,
   * protection in certain markets where regulations or distributor arrangements keep their competitors out for certain vehicle brands.
   * Brand name in certain regions where they operate.
* Downsides include:
   * susceptibility to economic downturns,
   * if interest rates climb it will make it harder for them to offer attractive financing,
   * 2021 supply chain shortages interrupting inventory,
   * High debt levels,
   * Competitive advantages, as I see them currently, are somewhat limited:
      * small pricing advantage over smaller competitors,
      * limited protection in certain markets where regulations or distributor arrangements keep their competitors out for certain vehicle brands.

The debt numbers are very concerning to me. In my research I did find that automotive retailers tend to carry a lot of debt, but interestingly enough some of that high debt is due to Floor Planning Debt. This is a form of revolving short-term debt by which they acquire vehicle inventories. The loans are paid as the inventory is sold, and the credit is ""recycled"" for new inventory. 

Based on the 2020 numbers, there is some good news to their liabilities. Lithia Motors' short-term assets do exceed the short-term liabilities. Compared to the long-term liabilities, the short-term assets are greater.

I did compare their 2020 numbers to a couple of competitors. Carmax, one of their biggest competitors, had a huge LT Debt/Earnings ratio of 20.7, revenue of roughly $19b, and EPS of $4.52. Carmax's growth number were much less overall comparatively.

Carvana, an all-digital, used-car market competitor. Revenue for 2020 was $5.5b, with negative earnings, and $1.6b in long term debt. Their Q1 performance did see growing revenue YoY, but their debt grew in turn.

AutoNation ($AN), another competitor that I compared to $LAD, had growth numbers that are less impressive than Lithia Motors', but they do have more long-term and better Free Cash Flow numbers.

About half way through my research Lithia made a rather big announcement. They're doing a new public offering of shares valued at $1b. At the same time, they announced a private offering of $800 million in senior notes (3.875%) that would be due 2029... Nearly another billion in LT Debt.  Looking at their 2021 Q1 presentation, they do give target uses of capital, which at least shows they have a plan that they are willing to publish. Those plans are as follows:

* Internal Investment &amp; Modernization 25%
   * (Actual 5-year average: 17%)
* Share Repurchases 5%
   * (Actual 5-year average: 11%)
* Dividends 5%
   * (Actual 5-year average: 4%)
* Acquisitions 65%
   * (Actual 5-year average: 68%)

Their stated goal in the 2021 Q1 for acquisitions is an annual addition of $3-5 billion in revenues. They also posted good numbers for Q1 YoY and compared to the previous quarter.  They also have an overall 5 year plan, announced last year, that intends to get to $50 billion in annual revenue and earnings per share of $50 by 2025.  

My valuations, factoring in a 15% annual return, worked out between $400.00-$450.00. The WSJ lists stock price target for $LAD at: 

* High $537.00
* Median $452.50
* Low $320.00 

My margin of safety numbers would put my buy range between $225.00 to $265.00.  So, I'd have a wait for an event to bring their current price down to this range.

289,,ValueInvesting,"It was a big day for the energy market today. OPEC+ agreed on their commitment to slowly ramping up production as the economy opens back up. I find energy in the near term (5 years) at a crossroad with little downside.

The energy industry is basically at a clean slate - a decade of overproduction and leverage and then the pandemic wiped out the remaining Pyrrhic American shale producers. 

The markets are betting against a sustainable $60+/b over the near term based on the price that many energy producers are trading at, but I think it's possible for the reasons below.

1). Saudi and Russia need a $65+ barrel to balance their budget and the Crimea Sanctions have really hurt the Russia economy; after the race to negative oil, it seems like Russia tapped out and will abide to OPEC+ as natural resources are 65% of their GDP. OPEC+ has a strong chance of staying in line in the near term.

2). GND initiatives/large debt buildups have inhibited the CapEx of many of the remaining energy producers. For these upcoming years most of Big Oil will focused on improving their balance sheet by paying down debt - let alone the fact that $XOM basically had a corporate takeover and $RDS an ugly upcoming legal battle w/ the Dutch govt. The Green New Deal can either be a positive or negative depending on the producer as in the short term the banning of fracking/drilling/streaking on Federal lands is a barrier to competition unless you're \~the\~ competition. Additionally, carbon capture technology could open up a brand new stream of income (not much in the near term - although the hype will be in the price). 

3). Economy opening up. The Fed setting rates at basically 0 has resulted in massive capital inflows in developing countries; countries that need transportable, cheap energy as the economy opens back up. 

Likewise, on the contrary, there's:

 1.b) the Iranian Nuclear Deal that would unleash \~4m barrels of oil into the market if a deal is struck

 2.b). Advancement in renewable technologies and methodologies (although, I don't know if that would have much of an effect in the near term \[global oil demand has been consistently growing since the 2000s\]).

I believe the real risk in upsetting a sustainable $60+/b in the near term is the Iranian Nuclear Deal. The opening of the economy would counteract this supply flood but immediately (w/ the obvious news blitz) the price of oil would crash resulting in the ability to buy energy producers at a discount (one reason why I am slowly cost averaging up).  

On the upside, I believe there's the possibility for a massive supply side squeeze for reason 1,2,3 said above resulting in a real possibility for sustainable $80+ oil in 1-2 years as the world economy opens up with the absence of the “drill baby drill” Shale Producers. I am currently bullish energy stocks - many of which are still trading at pandemic discounts and would have massive FCF near the Saudi or even Russian breakeven.

&lt;p&gt;1.b) the Iranian Nuclear Deal that would unleash ~4m barrels of oil into the market if a deal is struck&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.b). Advancement in renewable technologies and methodologies (although, I don&amp;#39;t know if that would have much of an effect in the near term [global oil demand has been consistently growing since the 2000s]).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe the real risk in upsetting a sustainable $60+/b in the near term is the Iranian Nuclear Deal. The opening of the economy would counteract this supply flood but immediately (w/ the obvious news blitz) the price of oil would crash resulting in the ability to buy energy producers at a discount (one reason why I am slowly cost averaging up).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the upside, I believe there&amp;#39;s the possibility for a massive supply side squeeze for reason 1,2,3 said above resulting in a real possibility for sustainable $80+ oil in 1-2 years as the world economy opens up with the absence of the “drill baby drill” Shale Producers. I am currently bullish energy stocks - many of which are still trading at pandemic discounts and would have massive FCF near the Saudi or even Russian breakeven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s your thoughts on the energy market and how are you going to play it (if at all)?&lt;/p&gt;

Pros:

* Debt less than cash on hand, so safe from bankruptcy.
* Continuing improvement on revenue and rigs usage.
* Lots of room to run if high oil demand is sustained for a couple years. At peak oil in 2014-15, its EBIT can earn the entire current market cap value ($3b) in about 3 years.

Cons:

* OPEC+ have a lot of additional capability that they can tap into to keep price depressed.
* Management is wary of the cyclical nature of energy so extreme growth through Capex and leverage is unlikely going forward.
* Regulations risk and millennial investors who dislike all things fossil fuel, so don't expect any help from the hype investors.

I analyzed 14 quarters of 13F data (everything that's available on Whale Wisdom) for Scion Asset Management. The goal of this analysis was two-fold. First, on the buy-side, are there any technical characteristics that can be gleaned from when the stock was purchased? Second, on the sell-side, which ones were ***potentially*** the most successful? Least successful? What's the overall success rate?

321,,ValueInvesting," Laser-guided forklifts which travel at 6mph generate a higher ROCE than 99% of the market.

Somero Enterprises Inc.

Lets at a look

**1) What they do?**

Somero was established during 1986 and revolutionised the concrete placement industry by bringing automation to the screeding process”.

**2) Technology**

Somero’s 1986 breakthrough was the introduction of laser-guided equipment, which helped ensure concrete floors could be laid much easier and with far more precision.

**3) Why is this important?**

Perfectly flat floors can significantly improve warehouse efficiency — forklifts can apparently travel safely at 6mph carrying goods instead of 2mph.

**4) Sounds good, what else?**

The CEO claims they have minimal direct competition, with unsurpassed quality and performance and unparalleled global service.

**5)** **Competition**

I must say, “minimal direct competition” and “unsurpassed quality” do sound very encouraging. and the truth is its backed up by A 30% margin and a 36% return on equity

**6) Risks**

The board is elderly — the chief executive is 71 and the non-exec chairman is 83. Succession planning may well be a regular discussion topic.

**7) A quick study of cash flow.**

Everything looks in order to me. True, Somero has absorbed a net $5m into working capital during the last five years. However, that sum is relatively small given net profit has grown from $5m to $18m during the same time.

**8) Debt &amp; Cash.**

Large debts have been paid off and the cash pile has ballooned. Most Importantly Going forward, the Board will look distribute 50% of the excess of net cash over the year-end target in the form of a supplemental dividend

**Conclusion** \- In my opinion a solid buy.

&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Now consider *speculative* return. As 2017 began, the
price/earnings multiple on stocks was 23.7 times. That
figure is based on the *past year’s reported earning*s of the
S&amp;P 500. If the P/E ratio remains at that level a decade
hence, speculative return would neither add to nor subtract
from that possible 6 percent investment return.     
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; **Wall Street strategists generally prefer to calculate the
P/E using *projected operating earnings for the coming year*,
rather than *past reported earnings* [Emphasis mine].** Such operating earnings
exclude write-offs for discontinued business activities and
other bad stuff, and projections of future earnings that
may or may not be realized. Using projected operating
earnings, Wall Street’s P/E ratio is only 17 times. I would
disregard that projection.   
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; My guess—an informed guess, but still a guess—is
that, by decade’s end, the P/E ratio might ease down to,
say, 20 times or even less. Such a revaluation would reduce
the market’s return by about 2 percentage points per year,
resulting in an annual rate of return of 4 percent for the
U.S. stock market.

Ben Graham recommended to invest 25 percent to 75 percent in bonds. In recent months, however, bonds have lowered in attractiveness. 

In September 14th 1981, the bond rate of a ten-year treasury yield was 14.91 percent. Granted, America had a short-time of stagflation (stagnant Inflation). However, in terms of today, the S&amp;P 500 generated a return of 15.76%. Yes, a bond holder then would have earned less; but, the risk of the Government defaulting would have been lower than the risk of the S&amp;P 500 collapsing due to the COVID-19 panic. However, as of May 17, 2021, the yield of a ten-year Treasury bond is only 1.63 percent. In some countries, such as Denmark in 2012, most of Europe in 2014, and Japan in 2014, the bond yields are actually *negative*. In other words, you lose money when you invest into the bond. The investor ill only make money if the price of the bond rises above the initial price. The only person who benefits is the Government. The Government can sell a bond for $100,000; and the investor only gets $90,000. The Government, ergo, get a profit of $10,000. 

Interesting fact, when the last 20 bear markets have happened (S&amp;P declining by 20 percent or more), the average return was a positive five percent. The last bull market (COVID-19), however, has a very low interest rate. Few stocks in Municipals (except for California Schools). My investment return was 42 percent last year. In short, it is best to be a part-owner of a company compared to low interest rates on bonds.

343,,ValueInvesting,"Hi,

This is a low cap stock, sorry if it's not allowed to be here.

It's a liquor retailer in Alberta, Canada.

They had liquidity problems due to high finance costs for a long time, but since a few years (2018) they seem to have turned it around.

They closed a few stores to pay off the debt, made a rebranding of the stores and switch the strategy to low prices, lots of promotions to add market share. Since 2018, the stores had organic growth every quarters. At the end of 2020, they had their lowest count of stores, 26, and recorded their best sales since 2016. (I'm scared this number is big because of Covid)

\-

At the current price of 8 millions dollars (0.165/Share),

47 millions in sales in 2020

1.5 million net income

2.4 millions in FCF in 2020 and 250k in 2019 (2019 - Finance costs were 900k, now reduced by 50%)

\-

Is this a good opportunity at a discount?

\-

The risk

\- What's the normalized amount of sales? I'm afraid that the 2020 number is this big because of Covid, no restaurants, no bars, this sure helped. However, the sales of the existing stores were growing organically in 2018, 2019. Even at 45 millions in sales, this would be enough to create positive FCF in my estimations.

\- Same management, why would this time be any different?

Thank you and any feedback is appreciated.

GUARDIAN ANNOUNCES MOUNT CAMERON, YUKON WORK PROGRAM

Guardian Exploration Inc. has contracted Aurora Geosciences, based in Whitehorse, Yukon territory, to perform a helicopter-supported field program at its 100-per-cent-owned Mount Cameron property, located in the Mayo mining district, Yukon territory, Canada.

Mineralization at Mount Cameron consists of structurally controlled polymetallic veining and manto-style carbonate replacement mineralization (CRDs) enriched in silver-lead-zinc (Ag-Pb-Zn). Mount Cameron is similar to other nearby polymetallic Ag-Pb-Zn deposits within the Keno Hill silver district.

Historic drilling previously performed at Mount Cameron in 1974 returned values of up to 6.1 metres of 287.3 grams per tonne silver, 26.5 per cent zinc and 5.78 per cent lead.",t2_1mrtgntu,False,,0,False,Does anyone know anything about Guardian Exploration (Trading symbol: GX)?,[],r/ValueInvesting,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_nmfahi,False,dark,0.67,,public,1,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Stock Analysis,False,1,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1622172168.0,text,6,,,text,self.ValueInvesting,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guardian Exploration to conduct Mount Cameron fieldwork&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In my life, I have developed a love for Restaurants. The unlimited drinks at a cheap price, the quality boneless Buffalo wings, I love it all. However, there is one thing I have noticed researching Restaurant stocks (starting with my favorite screener, Finviz): many of them are overvalued. Granted, the COVID 19 Disease has plagued and closed many restaurants; so its’ understandable if a restaurant temporarily loses money. However, if a company has little cash, negative cash flow, and a lot of debt, it is likely that the company will either had to get acquired by a speculator, reorganize, or, liquidate. I have three brief case studies that will show you how Restaurant stocks fare in the market.

**First is Dave &amp; Busters (PLAY)**, the Restaurant/Arcade amalgamation that is also noted for their Buffalo wings. The market capitalization for the company is $2.02 billion. In terms of stock price, the company has gone up in price. From $13.23 on August 21, 2020, the company now trades at $42.45. Is it worth it? Let us find out. 

The company’s equity is only $153 million ($169 million in 2020). With long-term debt, PLAY has $596 million in long-term debt. PLAY also has $1.3 billion in operating lease liabilities (which means that PLAY has a lot of rent to pay). In simpler terms, imagine having to pay $1.3 billion for an apartment without leasing it to anyone. The apartment would go out of business. And remember, the company has not fully recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic! 

Current Assets are low for the company compared to their liabilities. PLAY has only $11.9 million in cash, with only $24 million in inventories. The company also lost $49 million in Free-Cash-Flow. Yes, 2019 had a positive of Cash Flow ($288 million), which is a good way to pay off debt. However, it will take a couple of years before the Restaurant business recovers; and cash cannot pay off the debt. The company has an Enterprise Value (Market Capitalization plus Debt minus Cash) of $3.92 billion. Finally, the company trades at over 13 times its’ book value. 

Would you invest into a company with little cash, lots of debt, loss of revenue? Probably not. 

**Second is Potbelly Corporation (PBPB)**. The company is a sandwich shop that is based in the mid-West as well as select cities in states such as Texas. Akin to PLAY, the company has gained a lot in Stock price; going up from $3.50 in November 2020 to its’ current price of $6.97. Is the company worth $193.81 million? Let us find out. 

PBPB, if invested in December 2015, would only be worth $40 in December 2020. By contrast, $100 in the NASDAQ in the same time would be worth over $260 – and that is in spite of the Pandemic. In 2018, the company lost $8.54 million. In 2019, the company lost $23.59 million despite only having $13 million less in revenue (this was due to income taxes). In 2020, the company lost $65.67 million in 2020 due to the Pandemic. 

PBPB only has $11.13 million in cash, and $3 million in inventories. Operating lease liabilities is $35.32 million, wiping out the Current Assets ($23.31 million). Total liabilities are $277.90 million compared to only $283.36 million in assets. PBPB only as $5.5 million in equity; yet, is valued at $193.81 million! Imagine buying $5.50’s worth of Lemonade for $194. Net cash provided by operating activities has gone down from $31 million in 2018 down to $18.17 million in $11.61 million in 2020. 

PBPB’s price is not worth the value. 

**Third and finally is Noodles &amp; Company (NDLS)**

NDLS is exactly as it says in the tine: it sells Pasta meals. I have only been in there once in my life. The market values the company at $559 million. Akin to the other two food companies, NDLS has increased in Price over the past year (from $6.40 on November 2nd, 2020) to $12.34 on May 26, 2021. Is it worth the increase? Let us tune in, turn on, and drop out. 

Since 2016, NDLS has had a loss of net income four times (as high as $71.7 million in 2016) out of five.  With Cash Flows, NDLS has been variable, with last year generating only $9.12 million compared to $30.06 million in 2019. NDLS only has $7.8 million in cash and $9.6 million in inventories. Current Assets are $23.71 million. Current liabilities (including $26.1 million in current operating lease liabilities in 2020) are $58.13 million. In other words, immediate liquidity is impossible. Long-term debt is $41 million. 

NDLS may not be as bad as the other two stocks; but, it still is not worth the increase in stock price that happened this past year.

Prices should (in a perfect world) go up if the value is higher than the price. This is not a perfect world, however, and, the market does not reflect price in value sometimes.

353,,ValueInvesting,"First a timeline- When I  was introduced to the stock market in 2018, I started off as a value guy, keeping track of a few companies, eventually I got lured into the action of the stock market and dedicated the next 3 years to learning about, finance, derivatives and trading. I stopped focusing on value stocks until just recently after value investing reemerged into the public in the form of DFV and Michael Burry's positions, at least that is what I found, Since after these events I focused again on value investing, re-reading security analysis and intelligent investor.  

&amp;#x200B;

Before I left value investing for technical analysis and all that stuff, I found a stock called OAS (Oasis petroleum) I remember my basic analysis of it consisted of me finding the company below book value, looking at its free cashflow for the past 2 years, and just eyeing its net income which unfortunately was negative which I attributed to the recent sell off of crude oil in 2018. I didn't buy this company but I did recommend it as a good buy on the website ""Value investors club"", unfortunately I cant find my submission, and the only thing close to it is Oasis midstream partners, which isnt me.

&amp;#x200B;

After my crappy analysis I found the stock is now worth 86 dollars up from around 8 dollars when I made me submission and forgot about it. Now that would be great and all but apparently the company went through bankruptcy, and if you had followed the recommendation you would see the stock go to 0.20 before it went up to 86. 

So I think my focus on buying a company below its book value kind of saved me (that and not buying the stock) because as far as I know the shareholders are entitled to anything left over after obligations are paid, So if I really owned the stock maybe I would've averaged down, I just kind of forgot about it and here the stock is at 86. Im not sure If I really would've made a sizeable profit since in a bankruptcy everything is restructured and shareholders usually get nothing, but this stock was below book value, if you look at the chart you'll see a random jump from less than a dollar to around 30 over night,

&lt;p&gt;Someone analyzed them and can help me? What their normalize income after you delete one timeReassessment ? What going on their last report? Why they spent on financial investing 30 billion?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where there  Interest And Investment Income coming from on the last report coming from?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re having so many business and deals, I don&amp;#39;t succeed to decide if it&amp;#39;s a good thing, or it was better if they focus their main business&lt;/p&gt;

I'm lucky enough that from time to time I get a chance to interview small business owners, founders of startups and other investors. Recently, I got a chance to interview a small coffee shop owner whose coffee shop is known so well globally that people from all around the world come to see it. Usually, an indication of a strong brand moat is when SG&amp;A costs is declining but sales are increasing. This is exactly what I saw with this small coffee shop and I wondered how that was possible given the ever-increasing competition in the area.

I won't go in-depth into the strategy here cause it's just not the forum for it but when you understand the nuances of the strategy it's very hard for other coffee shops such as Starbucks to compete with it because it would require them to make a radical change in their marketing narrative.

371,,ValueInvesting,"How would you guys go about valuing a business like Lowes, whose revenue is highly correlated to very cyclical sectors of the economy: the housing market and the commodities market?

They’re trading at about 15x FCF, which is an extremely reasonable multiple (for developed companies like Lowes, with limited growth potential, I look for a multiple less than 20).

But that multiple is found within the context of an economic environment that, for a multitude of reasons, has lead to a dramatic rise in both housing and commodity prices ... which of course has helped to boost the bottom line of hardware stores like Lowes and Home Depot. 

Would you steer clear of companies like these, given their correlation to these two highly cyclical, price inflated, sectors (at least at the levels we’re currently seeing)? Or would you buy in given the reasonable multiple, and ability for the store to pass on inflated prices to the consumer?

&lt;p&gt;They’re trading at about 15x FCF, which is an extremely reasonable multiple (for developed companies like Lowes, with limited growth potential, I look for a multiple less than 20).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that multiple is found within the context of an economic environment that, for a multitude of reasons, has lead to a dramatic rise in both housing and commodity prices ... which of course has helped to boost the bottom line of hardware stores like Lowes and Home Depot. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would you steer clear of companies like these, given their correlation to these two highly cyclical, price inflated, sectors (at least at the levels we’re currently seeing)? Or would you buy in given the reasonable multiple, and ability for the store to pass on inflated prices to the consumer?&lt;/p&gt;

$HOPE

**Investment Thesis:**

With the recent spike in the 10-year yields worrying some investors and multiple stimulus bills being passed, printing money quicker than ever before, there is a constant worry amongst investors about rising inflation.

* To take advantage of this fact we need to find a stock/sector that outperforms the market when inflation rates rise.
* When inflation rises, regional banks enjoy an increase in their interest spread, this helps to increase the profit margins, which causes them to outperform the market during situations where inflation increases.
* My investment valuation and plan imply an upside of 35.99%, this will result in the price increasing from $15.66 (current price) to an estimated price of $21.29.

**Company Overview:**

Hope Bancorp provides banking services to small and medium sized businesses, as well as individuals in the United States. Hope Bancorp offers personal and business checking/savings accounts, money market, time deposits, and individual retirements accounts.

Hope Bancorp offers the following commercial loan products: business loans, real estate loans, small business administrative loans, consumer loans (mortgage, auto, credit etc.), and personal loans.

Hope Bancorp also offers trade financial services such as the issuance/negotiation of letters of credit, documentary collections, warehouse lines of credit, and commercial equipment lease financing.

Hope Bancorp also offers cash management services, which include remote deposit capture, investing/asset management, mobile banking, debit card, foreign exchange, safety deposit boxes, and many more.

Hope Bancorp has 58 branches in California, Washington, Texas, Illinois, New York, New Jersey, Virginia, and Alabama. Furthermore, Hope Bancorp has SBA loan offices in Seattle, Denver, Dallas, Atlanta, Portland, Oregon, New York, California, and Houston.

**Investment Information:**

*Macroeconomic Outlook:*

With the recent spike in the 10-year yields worrying some investors and multiple stimulus bills being passed, printing money quicker than ever before, there is a constant worry amongst investors about rising inflation.

However, when inflation rises there are certain sectors that outperform the market, one of these sectors being regional banks. This is largely due to the fact that when interest rates are up, these banks can charge more interest on the loans that they give out, and their interest spread increases, having a positive effect on their margins. This is especially important for regional banking stocks as increasing interest rates tend to help the regional banks more so than the large/diversified banks.

I am not a time traveller (I know it might be hard to believe), however interest rates are bound to increase back to their usual levels at around 2-2.5%, which would imply an increase of 23.15-53.94% (from the current yield of 1.62%). I do not know when the rates will recover to this benchmark (because once again I am no time traveller) but it is bound to happen eventually (likely in the next couple of years.

So, finding a high quality, and undervalued (both in terms of cash flows, and when comparing it to other banks) regional bank, will help you to achieve the best return when interest rates return to their natural levels.

[Regional Bank Stocks Rise as Bond Yields Climb - WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/regional-bank-stocks-rise-as-bond-yields-climb-11614681000)

*Financial Information:*

* Net Interest income (before provision for credit losses) is up 2% QoQ, to $122.6M
   * 3rd consecutive quarter of net interest income growth.
* Net income increased 54% QoQ to $43.7M
* Non-interest-bearing deposits increased 13% QoQ
   * Record high level for Hope Bancorp
* Time Deposits increased 11% QoQ
* Credit losses continued to be very small
   * $2.1M in credit losses (0.06% of loans receivable)
* Diversified mix of loans totalling $847M.
   * 55% Commercial and Industrial (C&amp;I) loans.
   * 37% Commercial Real Estate (CRE) loans
   * 8% consumer loans
* The average interest rate on their loans has increased by 5.2% QoQ
   * Rates increased from 3.27% (Q4 2020) to 3.44% (Q1 2021)
* Non-interest income decreased by 22.8% QoQ
   * This is due to fees they paid on swaps, and a decrease in deposit service fees from check cashing.
* Net gain on the sale of mortgage loans increased by 31.25% QoQ.
* Hope Bancorps deposit costs have decreased by 73.13% YoY
   * 34% (Q1 2020) to 0.36% (Q1 2021)
   * This should help to increase Hope Bancorp’s margins
* Hope Bancorp has a strong liquidity position of approximately $5B

Some of the most important information from this section is their net income increasing by 54% QoQ, the average interest rate on their loans increasing by 5.2% QoQ, their net gain on sale of mortgage loans increasing by 31.25% QoQ, and their deposit costs decreasing 73.13% YoY. These are all very important because they contribute to larger revenues and better profit margins. These factors will all contribute to making Hope Bancorp’s earnings report better and entice more investors into opening positions in their company. Furthermore, if Hope Bancorp is able to maintain these trends, then it is very likely that my DCF will be understating the fair value of $HOPE.

*Company Information:*

* Hope Bancorp has set out a near-term outlook which consists of:
   * Loan growth (forecasting a 5-9% growth rate).
   * Gain-on-sale Income.
   * Decrease Noninterest Expenses (improve their cost management).
   * Increasing their net interest margin by further decreasing deposit costs.
   * Lower their provision for credit losses to enhance profitability
   * Maintain sound management of credit, capital, and liquidity.

*Valuation Information:*

*WACC:*

I found Hope Bancorp’s WACC through a website called finbox in which they showed their calculations and how they arrived at their figure. They arrived at a WACC of 8.75%.

*CAGR:*

In order to find the CAGR I calculated Hope Bancorp’s average EBIT growth rate over the past 2 years, which turned out to be 11.97%. Then I found a CAGR on a website called Tracktak, which they calculated to be 10.13%. However, there is a small discrepancy between these numbers, so I averaged the two figures to arrive at a CAGR of 11.05% for my DCF model.

*Interest Expense Growth Rate:*

When looking at Hope Bancorp’s financials I noticed that their interest expense figures were very volatile but generally fell between the same range of numbers, so I decided to take their average interest expense over the past 10 years and took it as a constant (no increase or decrease).

*Tax Rate:*

I was able to find Hope Bancorp’s effective annual take rate in their most recent 10-K filing. They reported their tax rate to be 21.60%.

**Investment Valuation and Plan:**

*Valuation:*

In order to value Hope Bancorp ($HOPE), I performed both a DCF analysis and a comparable analysis.

*DCF:*

In order to come to a fair value through a DCF model, I used the information found in the “Valuation information” section. The DCF model that I conducted shows an implied upside of 35.99%, which would translate to a share price of $21.29. This upside is quite reasonable, however in order to validate this estimate I underwent a comparable analysis to see if there was any correlation.

*Comparable:*

The Comparable analyses that I decided to undergo include P/B, P/S, and P/E. The main comparable that I was looking at was their P/B. This is because in banks and insurance companies, most of their value sits in their book value. This multiple gives analysts the best price estimates for these types of companies. I also decided to do the P/E and P/S to give me more context as the EV multiples were not available for many regional banks.

P/B:

Based off of the P/B comparable, the estimated fair value of Hope Bancorp is $24.18, which implies an upside of 54.41%. This is a bit more bullish than the DCF model, however they are relatively consistent, and both confirm that $HOPE is indeed undervalued.

P/S:

Based off of my P/S comparable, the fair value of $HOPE is $20.44, which implies an upside of 30.52%. This is a bit close (and less bullish) than the DCF model, however once again it confirms the value in a stock like $HOPE.

P/E:

The P/E multiple is quite standard for investment analysts to use, with that being said my P/E comparable estimated an implied upside of 24.39% or a price per share of $19.48. Once again this is somewhat consistent with the DCF model and the other comparable.

Average Comparable:

The average price estimate from the 3 comparable analyses is $21.37 which implies an upside of 36.46%, this is within 8 cents of the DCF model. This is very good for me as an analyst to see because it shows consistencies in valuation which helps me to have conviction in the valuation and investment.

*Plan:*

Any entrance into a position in $HOPE under $17 will help you to limit the downside risk, while leaving enough potential upside for the investment to make sense and be worth your time and money.

I would sell my whole position once the price reaches the $21.29 level achieved in the DCF.

This plan (assuming you buy at the current price of $15.66) implies an upside of 35.99%.

**Catalysts:**

* Increases in the inflation rate and 10-year yield
   * These increases will increase the share prices whenever there is a sizeable jump, and it will increase slowly as these rates increase slowly back to their usual percentages.
* Meeting their near-term goals (should be reported in quarterly reports or investor presentations)
   * This will reflect higher growth rates and bigger profit margins which can help investors see the value in this company.

**Risks:**

* If the inflation rate and 10-year yield stay relatively near where they are now.  

   * This is very unlikely, but nothing is impossible, so I am not discounting this possibility
   * This will keep the stock where it is or even decrease the price as investors might sell their positions (because they bought in with the expectation of increased inflation)

**Portfolio Reasoning:**

* This stock fits in perfectly with the portfolio idea/thesis  

   * Undervalued
   * Small-Cap
   * Can take advantage of macroeconomic trends (ie. Increasing inflation) to accelerate share price growth.
* Helps to diversify this portfolio to mitigate risk.  

   * I have one stock in the insurance sector, which is somewhat related to banking, however regional banks operate quite differently than diversified (big) banks.
* Counterbalances my portfolio  

   * As inflation increases this stock will increase, however my previous stock addition ($MHO) will decrease as inflation increase.  

      * This helps to further mitigate the risk and make this portfolio safer.

&lt;p&gt;$HOPE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investment Thesis:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the recent spike in the 10-year yields worrying some investors and multiple stimulus bills being passed, printing money quicker than ever before, there is a constant worry amongst investors about rising inflation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To take advantage of this fact we need to find a stock/sector that outperforms the market when inflation rates rise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When inflation rises, regional banks enjoy an increase in their interest spread, this helps to increase the profit margins, which causes them to outperform the market during situations where inflation increases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My investment valuation and plan imply an upside of 35.99%, this will result in the price increasing from $15.66 (current price) to an estimated price of $21.29.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Company Overview:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope Bancorp provides banking services to small and medium sized businesses, as well as individuals in the United States. Hope Bancorp offers personal and business checking/savings accounts, money market, time deposits, and individual retirements accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope Bancorp offers the following commercial loan products: business loans, real estate loans, small business administrative loans, consumer loans (mortgage, auto, credit etc.), and personal loans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope Bancorp also offers trade financial services such as the issuance/negotiation of letters of credit, documentary collections, warehouse lines of credit, and commercial equipment lease financing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope Bancorp also offers cash management services, which include remote deposit capture, investing/asset management, mobile banking, debit card, foreign exchange, safety deposit boxes, and many more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope Bancorp has 58 branches in California, Washington, Texas, Illinois, New York, New Jersey, Virginia, and Alabama. Furthermore, Hope Bancorp has SBA loan offices in Seattle, Denver, Dallas, Atlanta, Portland, Oregon, New York, California, and Houston.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investment Information:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Macroeconomic Outlook:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the recent spike in the 10-year yields worrying some investors and multiple stimulus bills being passed, printing money quicker than ever before, there is a constant worry amongst investors about rising inflation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, when inflation rises there are certain sectors that outperform the market, one of these sectors being regional banks. This is largely due to the fact that when interest rates are up, these banks can charge more interest on the loans that they give out, and their interest spread increases, having a positive effect on their margins. This is especially important for regional banking stocks as increasing interest rates tend to help the regional banks more so than the large/diversified banks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not a time traveller (I know it might be hard to believe), however interest rates are bound to increase back to their usual levels at around 2-2.5%, which would imply an increase of 23.15-53.94% (from the current yield of 1.62%). I do not know when the rates will recover to this benchmark (because once again I am no time traveller) but it is bound to happen eventually (likely in the next couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, finding a high quality, and undervalued (both in terms of cash flows, and when comparing it to other banks) regional bank, will help you to achieve the best return when interest rates return to their natural levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Financial Information:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Net Interest income (before provision for credit losses) is up 2% QoQ, to $122.6M

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3rd consecutive quarter of net interest income growth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Net income increased 54% QoQ to $43.7M&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-interest-bearing deposits increased 13% QoQ

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Record high level for Hope Bancorp&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time Deposits increased 11% QoQ&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Credit losses continued to be very small

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$2.1M in credit losses (0.06% of loans receivable)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diversified mix of loans totalling $847M.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;55% Commercial and Industrial (C&amp;amp;I) loans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;37% Commercial Real Estate (CRE) loans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8% consumer loans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The average interest rate on their loans has increased by 5.2% QoQ

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rates increased from 3.27% (Q4 2020) to 3.44% (Q1 2021)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-interest income decreased by 22.8% QoQ

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is due to fees they paid on swaps, and a decrease in deposit service fees from check cashing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Net gain on the sale of mortgage loans increased by 31.25% QoQ.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hope Bancorps deposit costs have decreased by 73.13% YoY

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;34% (Q1 2020) to 0.36% (Q1 2021)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This should help to increase Hope Bancorp’s margins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hope Bancorp has a strong liquidity position of approximately $5B&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the most important information from this section is their net income increasing by 54% QoQ, the average interest rate on their loans increasing by 5.2% QoQ, their net gain on sale of mortgage loans increasing by 31.25% QoQ, and their deposit costs decreasing 73.13% YoY. These are all very important because they contribute to larger revenues and better profit margins. These factors will all contribute to making Hope Bancorp’s earnings report better and entice more investors into opening positions in their company. Furthermore, if Hope Bancorp is able to maintain these trends, then it is very likely that my DCF will be understating the fair value of $HOPE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Company Information:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hope Bancorp has set out a near-term outlook which consists of:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loan growth (forecasting a 5-9% growth rate).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gain-on-sale Income.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decrease Noninterest Expenses (improve their cost management).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increasing their net interest margin by further decreasing deposit costs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower their provision for credit losses to enhance profitability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain sound management of credit, capital, and liquidity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

381,,ValueInvesting,"MBH Corp. is a holding company that invests in non-public small and medium-sized companies from a wide range of sectors such as construction, education, trucking and manufacturing.

To date, the situation regarding this company has been ambiguous. During the quarantine period, the company lost 70% of its revenues due to the freezing of projects in the construction sector. On the other hand, the company actively expanded its list of portfolio companies through deals. The company raised funds through bond issuance.

The market reacted negatively to both of these factors. The disappointment in revenues can be considered reasonable, but such a significant decline in the company's value is also due to skepticism about the growth in debt obligations.

Despite the problem with the company's core sector, revenues are up 30% year-on-year, thanks to the success of other sectors, notably education. What will happen when the construction sector recovers, which analysts predict will go into growth in 2021-2022 as quarantine restrictions are lifted.

Thus, the company's value could increase by 1.5 times, if the current pace of revenue growth and recovery of the construction sector is maintained.

&lt;p&gt;Despite the problem with the company&amp;#39;s core sector, revenues are up 30% year-on-year, thanks to the success of other sectors, notably education. What will happen when the construction sector recovers, which analysts predict will go into growth in 2021-2022 as quarantine restrictions are lifted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, the company&amp;#39;s value could increase by 1.5 times, if the current pace of revenue growth and recovery of the construction sector is maintained.&lt;/p&gt;

[https://blog.tradint.io/whats-driving-the-huge-jump-in-carbon-dioxide-prices-in-europe-this-year-6af1c37fac26](https://blog.tradint.io/whats-driving-the-huge-jump-in-carbon-dioxide-prices-in-europe-this-year-6af1c37fac26)

Carbon dioxide and its presence in the atmosphere (greenhouse gas) in increasing amounts is one of the leading causes of global warming and climate change.

In December 2020, in light of the EU’s commitment to step up its fight against global warming and climate change, in accordance with the [Paris Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement) (UN Framework Convention on Climate Change), the EU set a long-term goal — the reduction of at least 55 percent in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.

In April of this year, an agreement was reached in the European Parliament on European Climate Law, which enshrines in law the target for 2030 (reduction in greenhouse gas emissions), and whose wording was approved by EU ambassadors.

The strategic goal is to achieve Net-Zero Emissions, by weighting the emissions against the active removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by natural or technological means (such as planting trees).

# Carbon Dioxide Trading

Since 2005, the EU has used a unique mechanism — the [Emissions Trading System](https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/ets_en) (ETS). The mechanism, which affects about 40 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, establishes for each company an annual allowance of emissions, with which it can trade with other companies. A company that by year-end will exceed the quota allocated to it, by weighting the allowances in which it trades with other companies, will be subject to significant fines. In this way, the EU makes it possible to significantly reduce emissions, without seriously harming companies, and allow them some flexibility in the process.

Private traders have at their disposal three tradable products that represent the price of Carbon according to its volatility in the ETS under the name [EUA Futures](https://www.nasdaq.com/solutions/eua-carbon-emission-futures-options):

1. daily contracts.
2. Quarterly contracts. (2021–2027)
3. Pre-delivery options to meet collateral requirements.

# The Significant Jump in 2021

Since the beginning of the year, the price of carbon has jumped more than 70 percent, reaching levels of over 55 euros per tonne. The direct causes of the increase are:

1. Added oversight.
2. The enshrining in the law of the ambitious target of reducing gas emissions by 55 percent by the end of the decade.

The trend (price increase) can be seen intensifying in mid-April and mid-May after the EU announced the submission of the law and the approval of the wording in parliament.

At the same time, the extreme cold wave that hit Europe in early January, and returned in early April, caused increased use of heating solutions that produce significant carbon dioxide emissions. [leading analysts to increase their forecasts](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-17/arctic-blast-will-prop-up-european-energy-prices-into-spring) on the price of Carbon dioxide.

# What to expect next

The issue of greenhouse gas emissions will continue to concern regulators in Europe and around the world. It will also lead to additional laws and regulations that will affect companies, particularly in the fields of energy, industry and manufacturing, and aviation.

[On May 24–25, the European Council will convene for a special meeting](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/meetings/european-council/2021/05/24-25/) to discuss the issue of climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, and provide further guidance on the issue. It is likely that the meeting will have an impact on the price of carbon.

[Analysts disagree about the rate of growth in the price of carbon](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/18/why-europes-carbon-market-is-experiencing-a-boom-like-never-before.html), Some claim it will continue to climb throughout the year to levels of over 100 euros per tonne, and some claim it will stabilize at around 40 in the coming year but will grow slowly until it at least doubles by the end of the decade.

It is worth following the reports and new regulations from government bodies in Europe and around the world, and pay attention to any new regulation that will directly affect Carbon activity and price.

As a result of the jump in the price of carbon, it is likely that we will see changes in companies that produce gas emissions. Especially from the energy-production, and aviation sectors, as well as the growth of companies that offer greener solutions.

[In addition, last year, China, too, committed ](https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy/news/china-considers-going-carbon-neutral-peaking-emissions/)to significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and will reach Net-Zero Emissions by 2060.

**Background**

A new plan was recently released in April for the restructuring of CBL Properties after they filed for bankruptcy in 2020. The plan provides a recovery for common and preferred shareholders, which is very rare in chapter 11 cases. Specifically, 11% of the common stock of the combined company will go to equity holders, with 5.5% going to preferred shareholders and 5.5% going to common shareholders. The remaining 89% will go to unsecured creditors. The current market value of the two classes of preferred shares (Ticker:CBLDQ and CBLEQ) combined is $24m (\~$1 per share), while the common trades at $20m market cap (\~$0.10 per share) (ticker: CBLAQ). Visit this website for all the information on the case: [https://dm.epiq11.com/case/cblproperties/info](https://dm.epiq11.com/case/cblproperties/info) 

**Thesis**

I believe the preferred and equity shareholders far exceeds their current market value, and these securities trade at 70-80% discount to their estimated recovery. Here are a few reasons why:

* Despite 2020's challenges, CBL still produced $140m in FCF if you exclude bankruptcy-related charges that won't continue after they emerge. If we assume there is no improvement in FCF after 2020, current preferred and common holder's share of FCF in the reorganized company will be $7.7m, or $0.30 per existing preferred share and $0.04 per common share (recall their current prices are $1 and $0.10, respectively). This means preferred shares are currently trading at 3x 2020's FCF, which the company achieved in almost apocalyptic conditions. FCF will undoubtedly be higher in the future and I estimate it will be around $0.50 per preferred share ($0.06 per common) after reorganization, which is half the current price of the shares.
* Using the cap rate method, net asset value of the shares that preferred and common shareholders will receive in the reorganized company will be around $3-$5 for the preferred and $0.40-$0.60 for the common, which is 3-5x their current price. This is based off of their 2020 net operating income of $400m, share in joint venture operating income of $94m, and a capitalization rate of 9-11%, which is far higher than cap rates for other mall REITS. This values CBL's real estate assets at around $4.5-$5.5b ($494m/.09, 494m/.11). The reorganized company will have about $3.6b in debt and other liabilities, including their share of joint venture debt. Along with cash and other assets, this leaves a net asset value of $1.4b-$1.8b for the reorganized company. Preferred shareholders and common each receive 5.5% of this reorganized NAV, which comes out to $76m-$100m, or the per share figures noted above. Commercial REITS of average leverage typically trade above NAV, and CBL will have below average leverage after they emerge, which means they are also likely to trade above NAV after reorganization, which means even more upside.
* The current market value of CBL's equity implies a cap rate of 14%, which is ridiculously high. Cap rates for similar mall REITS ranged from 7-9% during 2020. Even a 11% cap rate implies 200% upside. This means that downside risk for the preferred is extremely small.
* Before May 20, there was a ""deathtrap"" provision in the restructuring plan for the preferred and common shareholders, meaning that if they did not receive the necessary votes, they would receive nothing. However, in a hearing on May 20th, Judge Jones of Texas, the judge overseeing CBL's case, ordered CBL to strike out the deathtrap for the preferred shareholders. Before, there was the risk incumbent preferred shareholders would vote down the plan and the preferred shares would receive nothing. That risk has largely been eliminated. Preferred shareholders could vote against the plan and STILL receive the 5.5% in a ""cram-down"" scenario where the senior classes force the recovery onto the preferred shares, regardless of their vote. In this event, the common shareholders must receive nothing (this is the ""absolute priority rule""), but it means that there is a significant chance that preferred shareholders will receive their 5.5%.
* Preferred shareholders may still receive more than 5.5%, as the bankruptcy judge has said he is open to putting the 11% allocated to common and preferred in a trust for the allocation to be determined later. There is a very strong case that the preferred shareholders should receive more than 5.5% due to their seniority over the common.

**Risks**

1. If unsecured creditors, for some reason, vote against the plan, or Judge Jones strikes down the current plan, preferred shareholders will get nothing. 64% of the unsecured notes and 88% of the secured debt already approved the plan, which is in excess of the votes required for confirmation. However, there is always the chance it could fall through. Most of the unsecured notes are held by the Delaware Trust Corporation for its beneficiaries. This means the unsecured creditors are represented by one party. Upset that party, and equity holders could be wiped out. I find this unlikely, given the Delaware Trust Corporation is part of the creditor committee and already expressed approval of the plan, but at the end of they day they are looking to maximize their recovery. Anything could happen. 
2. The longer it takes to approve the plan and for the shareholders to receive the recovery, the less attractive and valuable CBL's shares are. There is always the chance this could drag on for much longer than we would like.

**Conclusion**

In summary, the preferred and common shares of CBL properties are trading at a significant 70-80% discount to their estimated recovery. I believe the preferred shares are much more attractive, because they offer similar upside to the common but much less downside, because there is still a world where common shareholders receive little to no recovery. That risk has been largely eliminated for the preferred.

&lt;li&gt;Using the cap rate method, net asset value of the shares that preferred and common shareholders will receive in the reorganized company will be around $3-$5 for the preferred and $0.40-$0.60 for the common, which is 3-5x their current price. This is based off of their 2020 net operating income of $400m, share in joint venture operating income of $94m, and a capitalization rate of 9-11%, which is far higher than cap rates for other mall REITS. This values CBL&amp;#39;s real estate assets at around $4.5-$5.5b ($494m/.09, 494m/.11). The reorganized company will have about $3.6b in debt and other liabilities, including their share of joint venture debt. Along with cash and other assets, this leaves a net asset value of $1.4b-$1.8b for the reorganized company. Preferred shareholders and common each receive 5.5% of this reorganized NAV, which comes out to $76m-$100m, or the per share figures noted above. Commercial REITS of average leverage typically trade above NAV, and CBL will have below average leverage after they emerge, which means they are also likely to trade above NAV after reorganization, which means even more upside.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The current market value of CBL&amp;#39;s equity implies a cap rate of 14%, which is ridiculously high. Cap rates for similar mall REITS ranged from 7-9% during 2020. Even a 11% cap rate implies 200% upside. This means that downside risk for the preferred is extremely small.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before May 20, there was a &amp;quot;deathtrap&amp;quot; provision in the restructuring plan for the preferred and common shareholders, meaning that if they did not receive the necessary votes, they would receive nothing. However, in a hearing on May 20th, Judge Jones of Texas, the judge overseeing CBL&amp;#39;s case, ordered CBL to strike out the deathtrap for the preferred shareholders. Before, there was the risk incumbent preferred shareholders would vote down the plan and the preferred shares would receive nothing. That risk has largely been eliminated. Preferred shareholders could vote against the plan and STILL receive the 5.5% in a &amp;quot;cram-down&amp;quot; scenario where the senior classes force the recovery onto the preferred shares, regardless of their vote. In this event, the common shareholders must receive nothing (this is the &amp;quot;absolute priority rule&amp;quot;), but it means that there is a significant chance that preferred shareholders will receive their 5.5%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preferred shareholders may still receive more than 5.5%, as the bankruptcy judge has said he is open to putting the 11% allocated to common and preferred in a trust for the allocation to be determined later. There is a very strong case that the preferred shareholders should receive more than 5.5% due to their seniority over the common.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If unsecured creditors, for some reason, vote against the plan, or Judge Jones strikes down the current plan, preferred shareholders will get nothing. 64% of the unsecured notes and 88% of the secured debt already approved the plan, which is in excess of the votes required for confirmation. However, there is always the chance it could fall through. Most of the unsecured notes are held by the Delaware Trust Corporation for its beneficiaries. This means the unsecured creditors are represented by one party. Upset that party, and equity holders could be wiped out. I find this unlikely, given the Delaware Trust Corporation is part of the creditor committee and already expressed approval of the plan, but at the end of they day they are looking to maximize their recovery. Anything could happen. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The longer it takes to approve the plan and for the shareholders to receive the recovery, the less attractive and valuable CBL&amp;#39;s shares are. There is always the chance this could drag on for much longer than we would like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, the preferred and common shares of CBL properties are trading at a significant 70-80% discount to their estimated recovery. I believe the preferred shares are much more attractive, because they offer similar upside to the common but much less downside, because there is still a world where common shareholders receive little to no recovery. That risk has been largely eliminated for the preferred.&lt;/p&gt;

Value investing consists of understanding stocks as part of businesses with an underlying value, having a long-term vision and using a margin of safety to minimize risk, but all this is subject to multiple interpretations and adapts to the personality of the investor.

391,,ValueInvesting,"Ally Financial (ALLY) has recently gained some popularity over the past few years. They have 2 main streams of revenue, personal banking and auto financing.

I'm personally drawn to this stock because of the personal banking. I bank with Ally and I really like it so far. Great saving rates, no fees, super user friendly app, great customer service, etc. What's interesting is they don't have physical locations. At first I was concerned about this, but, I haven't ran into issues.

To my knowledge the personal banking is relative new and growing. Recently they have entered into the investing world as well. I'm sure this will increase their onboarding.

They seem to have a good culture, the valuation is attractive considering the smaller size and growth, and they offer a dividend. Overall I like the company.

I think this could be a big win in a few years if they keep onboarding users. Ally is a ""cool new bank"" that is attractive to the younger generation. I understand doubling the user base will not happen over night but I can see consistent growth.

To get an idea of their size relative to other big banks, I'll list a few market caps of well known banks and Ally's below:

ALLY: 20B

WFC: 190B

BAC: 363B

C: 160B

JPM: 492B

Questions that I have:

The savings rates for Ally are higher than many other banks, how do they accomplish that? Lower margins?

Can they actually compete against the ""big banks""?

Do they operate differently? If so, how?

394,,ValueInvesting,"# How Walmart’s Web Traffic data perfectly predicted their surprising quarterly reports.

American retail giant Walmart Inc. ([WMT](https://www.investopedia.com/markets/quote?tvwidgetsymbol=WMT)) surprised all the financial analysts yesterday (May 18th), when they reported earnings. They blew away all estimates and posted impressive sales numbers. With E-commerce sales rising 37% year over year.

Upon release of the surprising reports, Walmart’s stock price rose significantly.

 So what if we could have known in advance, and predicted almost perfectly the growth in the retail giant’s E-commerce data? To answer this question we will dive into the company’s Web Traffic data.

# Web Traffic

When we surf the Internet, and access websites, our footprint remains both in the internal systems of the site, and in various tools and repositories, that collect this data. Web traffic is the number of visits to a site at a given time. The data can usually be seen in monthly / weekly / daily distribution and historical data can be examined (Some tools require payment, and some offer partial information for free).

Since Walmart’s E-Commerce business is based on visitors entering the company’s site, and purchasing products, we have hypothesized that the amount of web traffic to the site will predict and be somewhat correlated to its sales data from the product in question.

Using the [Semrush ](https://www.semrush.com/analytics/overview/?q=walmart.com&amp;searchType=domain)Web Traffic tool, we examined and compared the web traffic data to the Walmart retail site in the first quarter of 2020, compared to the first quarter of 2021.

In the first quarter of 2020, the web traffic to the site was: **January** — 202,217,552, **February** — 209,486,742, **March** — 215,756,823 for a **total of** 627,461,117.

In the first quarter of 2021, the web traffic to the site was: **January** — 283,487,106, **February** — 282,642,524, **March** — 278,975,827 for a **total of** 845,105,457.

This means that compared to the first quarter of 2020, when 627,461,117 people entered the Walmart site, 845,105,457 entered the site in the first quarter of 2021, **an increase of 35 percent!** (34,686).

As stated above, one of the major surprises in the reports released by Walmart is the **37 percent increase in e-commerce sales, a figure almost identical to the 35 percent increase in Web Traffic.**

Since Web traffic data is constantly updated, it was possible to access this data long before the reports were published, and predict the outcome with great accuracy.

This example shows the power of [Tradint](https://tradint.io/), and the ability of researchers to produce new research angles, capable of predicting companies’ performance based on unique data from around the Internet, and not just on the basis of economic data.

This is a company that became a YouTube favorite last year together with Bionano genomics. Cathie Wood started buying into them and then they exploded and became super popular. Their price went from the low 1-2$ to over 15$. During this run some interesting things happened. They started doing stock offerings. When the price went up with 50% they did another offering. The price was dropping 20% and then rallying again and then another offering was coming. They did this again and again and again and at some point people just said the company is diluting too much and it’s going to be a flop. And although usually second offerings are bad in this case I think it was brilliant for the company. Their price went way over what it is supposed to be and they took the advantage to hoard cash. So much that now they have 1.47 billion in cash and their entire market cap is 1.58 billion. That means if you would buy all the shares at the current market price you could pocket the cash and have the company for 110 mil and that makes this company to seem really cheap and the risk of the price going down significantly is really low. Even if the entire manufacturing world would stop today you would basically get 93% of your investment back. Their price was away from fundamentals based on hype and the company took advantage of that which I think it’s a smart move. Now the CEO said they will not do any more dilution because they have enough cash for their planned mergers and acquisitions and also for R&amp;D.

Since they hoarded this cash they acquired two companies: one that is expert in printing micro components (super small mechanical parts) and a machine learning company that they plan to use to improve the quality of their prints and make their 3D printers into a network of printers. I think both of these will help them make more complex PCBAs that could have studs and mechanical clips 3D printed and will reduce the time for assembly. At their last investors call they also announced that they will launch a new 3D printer in the summer. Also they are developing next-gen machines for production (expected to come in 1-2 years). And on top of this they are planning to acquire companies, including PCB manufacturers in Europe and/or US. Quick note: The CEO mentioned a few times they will not acquire companies just to acquire, they will buy someone when the price is right and it helps them to develop vertically and improve their printing tech.

Another way they are consuming the money is R&amp;D and marketing. They need to be heard of to be able to sell and they also need to have high tech. From what I understood they are using silver ink for conductive parts which is conductive enough for anything and for dielectric what they are using now can make PCBs but not high tech ones. They mentioned they made some breakthrough in dielectric materials that they can use but it’s not published yet what it is. It seems at least 30% of R&amp;D expense goes in the materials exploration. I personally love this because if they can position as leaders in this field and have the best tech their competitiveness will make them a behemoth in this field.

The company makes money in two distinct way: selling 3D printers for PCBAs for companies or printing PCBAs for companies as a service. Last year, due to corona their sale of 3D printers went down and that’s understandable. For their 3D printing service I think they are having an issue due to the shortage of semiconductors. Right now if you want to make a board you can print it in China and depending on how fast you want it ready it will cost you more. But if you are ok with waiting 4 weeks for your boards then they become really cheap. Due to shortages in components a lot of companies are ok with waiting because it doesn’t make sense to pay a lot to have your board fast if you need to wait either way for components. The trick is if you want to have it 3D printed by Nano Dimension it’s relatively expensive because it’s fast. Until the semiconductor shortage get’s a bit under control I see NNDM suffering in this field. I had a discussion with their sales representative and got an idea on their prices, it’s a bit high comparatively to traditional PCBAs, while the dimension of the PCBAs they can print is relatively small. Also the CEO said they do not plan to be operating cashflow positive in the next 2 years. This is because they want to expand and cash is not a problem (to put it in perspective, they have 1.4 billion in cash and the 2 new companies costed less than 200mil, R&amp;D costs for a quarter were 3.7 mil). It’s clear that the focus is growth and then switching to positive cashflow.

At their last investor call the CEO of NNDM is mentioning that he wants to revolutionize the printing of PCBAs so that you print just what you need. This will be interesting if it’s possible but I personally doubt this will happen in the next 3-4 years because I’ve seen personally how efficient factories are now when it comes to PCBA manufacturing. What I think it will happen (take this with a chunk of salt) is that they will start printing prototypes for a lot of companies and at some point those companies will just acquire 3D printers for a more agile development in their R&amp;D. Also the space industry will probably use them more and more (they already sent some 3D printed boards to the ISS).

Below you can see their price evolution and all the drops on the way up represent a new stock offering. You can also see that they are increasing their revenue year by year (with the exception of 2020 which is a special year). And they reduced the bleeding in cash flow in the last years. That will look worse for the next years but now they have cash to work with.

424,,ValueInvesting,"Disclosure I do not own any shares. 

I came across LOTZ in a stock screener as I had set a price target of $5 and noticed it got close to it.  To keep with the discipline of doing more research upon researching the 1st price target I dug deeper and did the following model.  

Summary
Carlotz is really a lead-gen tech business to help rental fleets and consumers sell directly to retail  vs. going through the auction process.  They eliminate the extra step and fees that is entailed in auction houses.  The company also allows consumers to sell their cars to other consumers with Carlotz being the ""broker"" that makes the process easy for both parties. 
The revenues are: flat fee from buyer, fee from seller (used to inspect, clean car and take pics), financing and insurance upsells and lease income.  

However, the company reports the total car sale as the revenue which is a bit funky but legal.  This is why the GROSS margins are 10% to 12%, if the Gross Margins were the ""revenues"" the company would only show a revenue of $35 million for 2021 vs. $350 million, kinda hard to sell a SPAC at a $1.4 billion valuation when the revenues are $35 but with eventual ""80% EBITDA margins"". 

I ran a 10 year model and do believe the company can become profitable by 2023 unless they keep expanding more aggressively than modeled but by 2024 they can grow organically using cash flow.  

I think the stock is a buy at $4 since at this price we have some downside protection of the cash on the balance sheet of around $2 and at that price you are only paying a 1x enterprise value to multiple multiple which is on the low side compared to historical of Carvana, KAR and others. 

Would I want to own this business forever?  No,  but I think it can go from $4 to $10 to $15 pretty quickly if the GROSS margins go to 13% to 15% as they originally projected in their investor presentation, however in my 10 year model I do not see 15% margins until 2030z Management has missed guidance on revenues for 2021 and margins and the street doubts they can meet their numbers for this year.  This is the risk and why I think it may trade lower in the short-term.  

2021 rev 330mm and 1x ev to sales would be $4 and 2x ev to sales is $8

2022 rev is 850mm and 1x ev to sales is $8 and 2x would be $16

2023 rev would be $1.4 billion and 1x ev to sales would be $12 and at 2x ev to sales would be $24

The execution risk is will they be able to meet these revenue targets and go from the current 10% gross margins to the 13% they said they would be able to do on the Octoeber 2020 investor deck. 

It could eventually become a takeover target as we have now 5 to 10 companies in this space and companies are always looking for growth. 

Anyway interested to hear your thoughts on this. I can definitely go more granular into the business model but for simplicity sake kept it short.

Looking forward to your comments!",t2_8s0zrgdc,False,,0,False,$LOTZ is this bottom for Carlotz? Or do we go lower? I think worth $4 to $24 over a few years.,[],r/ValueInvesting,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_nhvroa,False,dark,1.0,,public,11,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Stock Analysis,False,11,,False,True,self,1621681262.0,,[],{},,True,,1621641078.0,text,6,,,text,self.ValueInvesting,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclosure I do not own any shares. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came across LOTZ in a stock screener as I had set a price target of $5 and noticed it got close to it.  To keep with the discipline of doing more research upon researching the 1st price target I dug deeper and did the following model.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summary
Carlotz is really a lead-gen tech business to help rental fleets and consumers sell directly to retail  vs. going through the auction process.  They eliminate the extra step and fees that is entailed in auction houses.  The company also allows consumers to sell their cars to other consumers with Carlotz being the &amp;quot;broker&amp;quot; that makes the process easy for both parties. 
The revenues are: flat fee from buyer, fee from seller (used to inspect, clean car and take pics), financing and insurance upsells and lease income.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the company reports the total car sale as the revenue which is a bit funky but legal.  This is why the GROSS margins are 10% to 12%, if the Gross Margins were the &amp;quot;revenues&amp;quot; the company would only show a revenue of $35 million for 2021 vs. $350 million, kinda hard to sell a SPAC at a $1.4 billion valuation when the revenues are $35 but with eventual &amp;quot;80% EBITDA margins&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ran a 10 year model and do believe the company can become profitable by 2023 unless they keep expanding more aggressively than modeled but by 2024 they can grow organically using cash flow.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the stock is a buy at $4 since at this price we have some downside protection of the cash on the balance sheet of around $2 and at that price you are only paying a 1x enterprise value to multiple multiple which is on the low side compared to historical of Carvana, KAR and others. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would I want to own this business forever?  No,  but I think it can go from $4 to $10 to $15 pretty quickly if the GROSS margins go to 13% to 15% as they originally projected in their investor presentation, however in my 10 year model I do not see 15% margins until 2030z Management has missed guidance on revenues for 2021 and margins and the street doubts they can meet their numbers for this year.  This is the risk and why I think it may trade lower in the short-term.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2021 rev 330mm and 1x ev to sales would be $4 and 2x ev to sales is $8&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2022 rev is 850mm and 1x ev to sales is $8 and 2x would be $16&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2023 rev would be $1.4 billion and 1x ev to sales would be $12 and at 2x ev to sales would be $24&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The execution risk is will they be able to meet these revenue targets and go from the current 10% gross margins to the 13% they said they would be able to do on the Octoeber 2020 investor deck. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could eventually become a takeover target as we have now 5 to 10 companies in this space and companies are always looking for growth. &lt;/p&gt;

428,,ValueInvesting,"Since y'all seemed to enjoy my telecom company [analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/), I thought I would share this one I put together for cruise ship companies. I had a suspicion that because this industry suffered so much during Covid there might be a value opportunity here, but based on my analysis the financials simply don't support that thesis. 

With VZ, looking at the financials led me to further efforts: researching the nature of the telecommunications industry, the management team, wall street sentiment, and much more before I eventually purchased for myself (bought @ 55.87!). Here, I have not been nearly as thorough in investigating these intangibles because for me and my portfolio, the financials of these companies are a non-starter. If I had to pick a favourite it would be CCL (LIND for least favourite), but I do not own any of these companies and have no plans to purchase. If you have more info than me and think one or more of these companies are strong buys then tell me! I would love to have my mind changed and make some $$$.

**Model**: 

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bOtF0m9AiS8OLVCeCfISRfiTwQGIGQ1cjWj3goP\_ro4/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bOtF0m9AiS8OLVCeCfISRfiTwQGIGQ1cjWj3goP_ro4/edit?usp=sharing)

**Methodology**:

* Created a three-statement model for Carnival Corp., Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd., Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., and Lindblad Expeditions Holdings Inc.
* Combined these with a WACC build-up to create an unlevered DCF and derived a fair-value-per-share estimate using a growth in perpetuity and an exit EBITDA multiple approach
* Spread comparable companies (these 4)
* Combined results from DCF and select comps valuations to arrive at final estimates

**How to use the model**

* Anywhere you see blue text is OK to edit, and should not result in breaking anything. Green text = taken from another worksheet, so if you want to change one of those cells I recommend following the trail first
* To make meaningful changes to the 3-statement-model, scroll to the bottom of each ""Financials"" page to tweak assumptions about revenue growth, GPM, and other assumptions. You can also adjust the specifics for each case scenario from here
* I have tried to supply somewhat pessimistic assumptions about terminal growth rates and exit EBITDA multiples in the DCF models. Feel free to adjust as needed, keeping in mind the model is very sensitive to these inputs
* WACC buildup can be done however you want. If you have access to a Bloomberg terminal you can get a better adjusted beta than I used, and a more precise cost of debt (more on that below), or you can just use the override cell to put in a WACC% directly
* Trading Comps Input essentially works to arrive at normalized multiples before converting to an output. Do not be intimidated by non-Gaap disclosures. Everything here is available on annual reports, quarterly reports, and press releases.
* For trading comps outputs, simply toggle the companies in column B until you have the company you wish to analyze in the first position, and the other comps below it, then head to Valuation Matrix to see the results.
* Feel free to adjust the assumptions, there are a lot of them
* If you can think of an assumption better than something I have here, or if you spot a mistake let me know!

**Other Notes:**

* The analyst consensus for revenue increases from 2021 -&gt; 2022 are insanely high, but yes cruises are expected to rebound by that much 
* The glaring issue with the comps analysis is that there simply aren't enough of them. I considered including Disney as a sort of look at what these cruise lines would all dream of being one day, but that was too much of a reach. If Disney Cruises released their financials separately that would be a different story, and beyond that I couldn't find any reasonable comps.
* Sadly, the best comparable missing, MSG cruises, is a private company :(
* Super low valuations for RCL and LIND are not mistakes...(unless they are), valuations so separated from fundamentals like this make me think something else is going on (industry consolidation? Upcoming M&amp;A? Who knows)
* I try to be harsh on my fair value estimates to protect myself from making bad buys! Keep that in mind. I only want to put my capital where there is undeniably a value opportunity
* I Imported the model from excel to Google Sheets before sharing, so if something is broken, let me know so I can go in and fix it ASAP
* Used 10Y YTM bond data on FINRA when possible to arrive at assumptions for cost-of-debt used in WACC build-up. If you have access to a bloomberg terminal you can grab the bond with the best volume and use that.
* I apologize for ambiguity (especially on the non-gaap stuff) but I couldn't figure out how to remove my name from the comments quickly (if you know how to do this, other than going one-by-one through each comment, let me know and I'll reupload). Most comments were simply memos to myself to remember what each cell consists of beyond the label (i.e., components of ""other current assets"")
* A thousand more things. If you want to know just ask.

**None of this is financial advice. This is an exercise I did for my own use and thought this sub might find it entertaining.**  
**Do your own Due Diligence.**  
**I do not own any of these stocks.**

431,,ValueInvesting,"GEO is a REIT, that invests in private prisons and mental health facilities in North America, Australia, South Africa and UK. Price is currently at \~6$ per share, market cap 740M. Price has been recently hit as US government contracts have not been renewed, and half of their revenues come from government contracts. There is a lot of negativity around prison stocks, and big banks have also declared they are not going to fund debt of private prisons companies.

PE=5.3, Operating Margin 10%, EV/EBITDA 9, Debt/Equity 3.9.

I am trying to value this stock. I have 3 ways to calculate intrinsic value:

IV1: FCF is \~300M in the last TTM. Revenue and CF in the last years have been really stable. Given that the operations will be cut in half (as I stated above), let's suppose they will have half of the FCF for the next years, i.e. \~150M. Considering no growth, and 10% discount rate, a simple DCF gives an intrinsic value of 1,470M, i.e. 12$/share (2 times the price it is now!).

IV2: However this does not consider debt. To consider debt I usually calculate the net debt: total liabilities less cash, which is \~3,270M. I then subtract the net debt to the calculated intrinsic value, which is 1,470M less 3,270M... which is negative! So my usual analysis tells me this company is valued less than 0! This might be too conservative maybe? I know that REIT usually have high debt (I think 3.6 on average...), and it is normal.

IV3: Third way is to calculate liquidation value. They have 3.6B of assets (total asset less goodwill) vs 3.5B of total liabilities. So asset less liabilities is  \~100M, i.e. 100M/122shares outstanding gives 0.82$/share, much less then the price now...

**Question 1: how should I value this company or REITs in general?**

Management has decided to not issue the recent dividend, to repay debt. This is a good sign and shows responsibility from the management. Since most of the investors were in for the dividend (it is a REIT...) the price has been hit after the announcement.

Before the end of the year, they need to decide if they want to keep being a REIT (which means they HAVE TO issue dividends) or not. The second option I think is better because it allows them to deleverage, and I think it is good for shareholders as well. 

**Question 2: How do you think the transformation from REIT to a non-dividend paying company will be perceived by the shareholder? Will they dump the stock as when they cut the dividend last quarter?

Enabling hardware serves a very similar function in our world today, the ""Third Wave"" economy as Alvin Toffler put it, to the function served by ""the means of production"" in decades past.

If you wonder why countries on the come up, from China to India to Brazil, are so intent on building out their own home-grown capacity for hardware production, look no further than Apple and Facebook.

***Facebook*** *is an enabling software platform*. It gives smaller fish (mostly smaller and middle sized businesses) access to an awesome amount of data and analytics on which to advertise.

***Apple*** *is an enabling hardware platform*. It also provides access to a great deal of data and analytics, and supplies platforms (Apple's app store, the iPhone OS, built in apps like News+, etc) to businesses galore, but Apple has one massive advantage Facebook does not - control of the production, top to bottom.

Apple dictates the hardware stream, by way of being of such massive scale they are essentially the only customer of importance to whatever chip manufacturer they decide to bless. Further they own the hardware within the iPhone and this acts as the gateway to everything, including \*trumpet sounds\*... Facebook on the iPhone.

Apple didn't invent this. It's how Microsoft and Cisco have buttered their bread for decades, and handily dispatched virtually all competitors. Amazon understands it well, and how they managed (so far) to survive amongst whales.

438,,ValueInvesting,"Hello
 
I'm new. I’ve been investing in an ETF for a while reading up on different investment strategies. Value investing makes the most sense to me and I’m currently making my way through a few books on it as well as perusing this sub.
 
The issue I’m currently considering is when it becomes worthwhile to commit to a value investing strategy. There are a couple things I’ve been considering which I would like the communities’ views on:
 

Use of my time. Between family and work, I only have so much free time. While I’ve been enjoying learning about value investing, it seems like doing DD can be time consuming and not always interesting. How much time do you typically devote to furthering your knowledge and DD?

Value of my time. I currently invest 2.5hrs of my net pay per week. If I value my free time at the same rate, it would take some enormous returns (above the benchmark) to justify spending several hours a week learning and doing DD (at least initially). I suspect an investment in value investing would only start paying off after a few years of building up my portfolio and once I can afford to put more of my resource towards investing. In saying that, taking the time to master the craft now will hopefully pay off when I have a larger portfolio. At what point did value investing start paying off for you?

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your recommendations!&lt;/p&gt;

This is a portion of some of my recent inflation DD from researching Michael Burry/Scion's recent 13F plays. I thought it was an interesting investing strategy and wanted to share it here in case anyone is interested. There's more research over on [r/Burryology](https://www.reddit.com/r/Burryology/) (specifically [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Burryology/comments/nepc7l/the_bull_is_gasping_major_themes_from_michael/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)).

***Inflation, inflation, inflation! (21%+ of current holdings)***

If you've been following [r/Burryology](https://www.reddit.com/r/Burryology/) since its inception many eons ago (a little over a month ago), you likely guessed that the next 13F would reveal Burry's strategy for hedging and/or profiting off of the inflation situation. Would he buy/hold REITs as the hedge? What about gold, oil, and other commodities? Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS)?

We now have the answer.

Here are the direct inflation plays:

*Put options on* [***Ishares 20+ year treasury bond etf (TLT)***](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/031915/overview-tlt-etf.asp) *-* *12.7% of current holdings*

*Probable Burry thesis:* rising inflation over the mid- to long-term will lead to the need to increase interest rates thus making these 20 year bonds less attractive.

*Some context:* The U.S. Treasury announced plans to start issuing 20-year treasury bonds in January 2020. The benefits to 20 year treasury bonds are that they're relatively safe, their value could increase if interest rates drop, and they're relatively liquid. The cons are that they're over a 20 year period (meaning you lock in very low interest rates at which you get paid), inflation may occur over that 20 year period and lead to an increase in interest rates that you'll miss out on, and rising interest rates in general hurt the value of these bonds ([link](https://www.mybanktracker.com/blog/investing/20-year-treasury-bonds-307834)).

*Call options on* [*Proshares trust ultrashort lehment 20+ year treasury etf (TBT)*](https://www.zacks.com/funds/etf/TBT/profile) *- 4.1%*

Probable Burry thesis: this is the same 20+ year treasury bond mentioned above so the strategy is likely the same. The difference here is that it's a call on an inverse bond ETF.

*Context:* The ProShares UltraShort 20+ Year Treasury seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses that correspond to two times the inverse of the daily performance of the ICE U.S. Treasury 20+ Year Bond Index. (from Zacks article linked above).

*Put options on Ishares* [russell 2000 growth](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/russell2000.asp) *etf (IWO) - 3.1%*

*Probably Burry thesis:* There are two possibilities here. One is that the Russell 2000 is overpriced having outperformed the S&amp;P 500 at 81% vs 43% since last May. The other is that inflation will lead to a recession that does actual damage to the economy which effectively makes a short on the Russell 2000 a bet against the overall economy.

*Context:* The Russell 2000 index measures the performance of the 2000 smaller companies that are included in the Russell 3000 index which itself is made up of nearly all U.S. stocks. It is seen as a bellwether of the American economy because it measures the performance of smaller businesses focused on the domestic market. It's considered more cyclical than the larger indexes which is to say that it follows the economy tightly.

*Others:*

1. *Shares of* *Proshares trust ultrashort lehment 20+ year treasury etf (TBT) - 0.5%*
2. *Call options on Proshares ultrapro short 20 + year t (TTT)*

***Out with the REITs***

One of the more interesting observations from Scion's Q4 2020 13F was a sleuth of positions in various REITs. He had a little over 17% of the portfolio in REITs:

* Uniti Group Inc - 3.98% (now 0%)
* The GEO Group Inc - 3.51% (now 0%)
* RPT Realty - 4.05% (now 0.5%)
* Urstadt Biddle Properties Inc - 2.81% (now 0.1%)
* CoreCivic Inc - 3.07% (overall net increase in the total position, now 0.7%)

In Q1 2021, REITs accounted for just 1.3% of Scion's holdings. He exited out of Uniti and GEO, trimmed Urstadt and RPT Realty, and increased the CoreCivic position. All-in-all, it seems he's bearish on REITs serving as the best vehicle for profiting off of inflation compared to shorting the 20 year treasury bond.",t2_ajdjb39d,False,,0,False,How to hedge against inflation Michael Burry style,[],r/ValueInvesting,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_neqav6,False,dark,0.97,,public,288,2,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Discussion,False,288,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1621310625.0,text,6,,,text,self.ValueInvesting,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a portion of some of my recent inflation DD from researching Michael Burry/Scion&amp;#39;s recent 13F plays.

478,,ValueInvesting,"Hello everyone!

Since my last post 2 months ago (on r/richdudepoordude) I have received a lot of messages requesting me to give an update on how my SuperFund has been doing. Also, the SuperFund portfolio is purely value investing (or at least its base is) but I never shared this in r/ValueInvesting community (I have no idea why). So here it is.

If you are seeing it for the first time and wondering what the update is about then you can find my last post here: [I created a SuperFund portfolio based on 13F filings of Super Investors](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/lrad8t/i_created_a_superfund_portfolio_based_on_13f/). You can also check other updates on my account.

First things first, I hope you are all ""investors"" and not ""traders"". To me, anyone who buys and sells a position within 1 year just for profits is a trader. Investors are the ones who buy companies which they never plan to sell. They invest. It is important for me that my readers understand this difference because only with an investor's mindset can you understand SuperFund; only then can you appreciate the work and patience that goes into managing this fund (even so if it is only on paper).

Now that is out of our way, it is time for some good stuff (again)!

Since majority of us will agree that last week was more bearish than bullish, I have explicitly mentioned results of last week here. Between 10th May and 14th May 2021, SuperFund did +5.73% whereas S&amp;P500 gave a return of -1.38%. As you can see the SuperFund outperformed S&amp;P500 with a fair degree.

In my last post I received some useful feedback that I should compare performance of SuperFund against not only S&amp;P500 but also against NADAQ and QQQ. I took your feedback and included it in my method. If you're wondering what's the performance for the last week? Here it is:

Table 1.  Last week's performance of SuperFund compared against other benchmarks 

|From|To|SuperFund |S&amp;P500 |NASDAQ	|QQQ|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|10-May-21 |14-May-21 |5.73%	|\-1.38%	|\-2.34%	|\-2.34% |

As you can see, SuperFund was not affected badly by the bearish market sentiment.

Considering people's kind requests, I also decided to compare the performance of SuperFund against all these benchmark from the date I started this fund. Here it is:

Table 2.   Overall performance of SuperFund against other benchmarks 

|From|To|SuperFund |S&amp;P500 |NASDAQ	|QQQ|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|08-Sep-20 |14-May-21 |57.82%	|21.79%	|23.80%	|20.91% 	|

The fund consists of 24 publicly listed companies based in USA and that is why I compare it against S&amp;P500. Being that said, the idea behind this fund is not to compete against anyone, it is just to demonstrate how we as retail investors can sit on shoulders of the giants and buy good companies that generate profits for their shareholders. This is evident as in the period of 9 months the SuperFund did 57.82% where S&amp;P500 only did 21.79%. 

Someone also mentioned that I should compare SuperFund against top 10 holdings of S&amp;P500. And so I did. Since I started the fund, it did +57.82% whereas top 10 S&amp;P500 holdings gave a return of 21.04%.

Note: If you compare this with the return from entire S&amp;P500, you will notice how close the performance of top 10 holdings is to the overall index. This just indicates that the skewedness of S&amp;P500.

Anyway, here are some more numbers for some of you number lovers:

Table 3.  SuperFund volatility compared to S&amp;P500 volatility since 8th September 2020 

||Daily Volatility	|Annual Volatility |
|:-|:-|:-|
|SuperFund |1.3373%	|17.8924% |
|S&amp;P500 |0.9997%	|13.3751% |

SuperFund is definitely (slightly) more volatile than the S&amp;P500 index, but it also gives greater rewards. 

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

Now that was all about performance till last week end. A lot has happened since! New holdings of my favorite super-investors are public now and so have I updated the holdings of SuperFund.

Major changes are selling EVA, HE, DAR, LIND, UFI, AFI, and VNO (I don't want to type all company names but you can look up these tickers). Profits made from selling these positions has been reinvested along with new cash.

Newly added positions are the following (their weight in SuperFund in paranthesis):

* BABA (9.16%)
* VIAC (8.32%)
* PSFE (4.79%)
* NSIT (4.37%)
* CHK (2.17%)
* DHI (2.07%)

""Okay you sold some positions and you bought some new positions, but what effect does it have on the performance of SuperFund?"" If you're thinking the same then I have the answer:

Before making changes to the SuperFund, the invested capital was $10,000 and the portfolio value was $15,782. After the newly made changes, the total invested capital is $17,422 and the portfolio value is $23,071 (as on morning of 18-may-2021). There has been substantial addition of invested apital which has diluted the previous profits by about 25 percentage points. This is nothing to be worried about as the overall portfolio performance is 32.42% which is still 11 percentage points higher than S&amp;P500 (21.48%).

All in all I am curious to see the performance of the SuperFund portfolio recorded on 7th September 2021 (1 year performance).

&amp;#x200B;

I try to implement all the feedback I receive from my fellow investors to improve the SuperFund, so if you have any feedback then please comment below this post. I also received other comments which I plan to address in future posts. I have already started working on analyzing historical data to tell me how SuperFund would have performed in past 10 and 20 years. I will be posting those updates on this subreddit. Also I have created a YouTube channel: [Rich Dude Poor Dude](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChm1WDKPwQOfj5gfdNFYGiQ). There's no content on it yet but I will start recording content soon. It will be purely educational and entertaining. Please consider subscribing if you like what I do.

489,,ValueInvesting,"Hello fellow investors.

Don't know if this is interesting for this sub, but I wanted to share some thoughts with you concerning the Bund market.

I'm trying to hedge a bit my portfolio against an increase in rates. As I'm Europe and most of my value portfolio is European, and to protect it, I prefer to rest on EU market products.

Of course, it's not only a matter of hedgeing, is also that I think this is a good opportunity. I think that rates are going to keep their increase trend, so why not to benefit from it.

 I don't want to write a very long post that nobody will read, but muy reasoning is based on three main reasons:

-Politics: some troubles are to be expected, not only because there will be major elections in the next months (Germany this year, France next), but also because with the lift of the lockdown, I think some social troubles that has been in pause during the pandemic are going to regain momentum, therefore, populism is going to rise, increasing worries on national expending. This at national level, but there will also some conflict between the  UE countries, periferics and centrals, more or less like in 2012.

-Macro: Inflation is coming to Europe no matter why. Manufacturing cost are increasing in China, commodities are getting more expensive and stocks are low. This means that for the next 12-24 months I expect that Europe imports inflation from other countries, first because we are extremely dependent on basic products from China, and then because commodities are paid in USD.
Of course, oil is still a big issue concerning prices, but less than previous years, but we are leaving oil as main energy source to increase electricity, which is far more expensive when you consider the investments that are needed (batteries for cars, electric network, etc)

-Micro: to start, there is a lot of people who have saved a lot of money during the last 12-14 months, they want to expend it all, increasing prices, once prices are up, they rarely go back down. On the other side, governments and low rates for corporate loans have saved lots of companies from bankruptcy thanks to the pandemic relief plans, but this is going to end soon, therefore, the rates of commercial loans are going to rise.

Don't forget that in Europe, the banks finance the big companies as they use less corporate bonds than in US. Right now, housing market is very high almost in every EU country, I expect bank's risk managers to decide to reduce mortgage exposure to increase corporate loans as rates will get more interesting because of the increase of bankrupt risk as I've told but also because the ones that survive will have good results, and will invest because of the prices increase.

I don't know if this is clear, but for me, there is a snowball that is starting, and a lot of accelerator factors.

On the other side, this is Europe, I don't expect the situation will go out of control. But if the EONIA is about -0.5% right now, I expect about 1% in the next 12-24 months, 2% tops, because unemployment is high.

Nevertheless, this is a good opportunity knowing that finding good value opportunities is hard in current market.

I've thought about this and I decided to invest in the bond market, but as I don't like to take big risks, I'm avoiding complex short term derivatives, at least directly. Also, I wanted a liquid market to avoid market manipulation. Therefore, I'm buying a short etf on the Bund market

There is not a lot of choices tough, but I liked this one:

You can see that the reference Index is quite well built, mostly because it has a system to avoid technical breakdowns, that are quite common in these times of automatic trading (remember the oil futures market in May 2020).

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t know if this is interesting for this sub, but I wanted to share some thoughts with you concerning the Bund market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m trying to hedge a bit my portfolio against an increase in rates. As I&amp;#39;m Europe and most of my value portfolio is European, and to protect it, I prefer to rest on EU market products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, it&amp;#39;s not only a matter of hedgeing, is also that I think this is a good opportunity. I think that rates are going to keep their increase trend, so why not to benefit from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to write a very long post that nobody will read, but muy reasoning is based on three main reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Politics: some troubles are to be expected, not only because there will be major elections in the next months (Germany this year, France next), but also because with the lift of the lockdown, I think some social troubles that has been in pause during the pandemic are going to regain momentum, therefore, populism is going to rise, increasing worries on national expending. This at national level, but there will also some conflict between the  UE countries, periferics and centrals, more or less like in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Macro: Inflation is coming to Europe no matter why. Manufacturing cost are increasing in China, commodities are getting more expensive and stocks are low. This means that for the next 12-24 months I expect that Europe imports inflation from other countries, first because we are extremely dependent on basic products from China, and then because commodities are paid in USD.
Of course, oil is still a big issue concerning prices, but less than previous years, but we are leaving oil as main energy source to increase electricity, which is far more expensive when you consider the investments that are needed (batteries for cars, electric network, etc)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Micro: to start, there is a lot of people who have saved a lot of money during the last 12-14 months, they want to expend it all, increasing prices, once prices are up, they rarely go back down. On the other side, governments and low rates for corporate loans have saved lots of companies from bankruptcy thanks to the pandemic relief plans, but this is going to end soon, therefore, the rates of commercial loans are going to rise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t forget that in Europe, the banks finance the big companies as they use less corporate bonds than in US. Right now, housing market is very high almost in every EU country, I expect bank&amp;#39;s risk managers to decide to reduce mortgage exposure to increase corporate loans as rates will get more interesting because of the increase of bankrupt risk as I&amp;#39;ve told but also because the ones that survive will have good results, and will invest because of the prices increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if this is clear, but for me, there is a snowball that is starting, and a lot of accelerator factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other side, this is Europe, I don&amp;#39;t expect the situation will go out of control. But if the EONIA is about -0.5% right now, I expect about 1% in the next 12-24 months, 2% tops, because unemployment is high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, this is a good opportunity knowing that finding good value opportunities is hard in current market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve thought about this and I decided to invest in the bond market, but as I don&amp;#39;t like to take big risks, I&amp;#39;m avoiding complex short term derivatives, at least directly. Also, I wanted a liquid market to avoid market manipulation. Therefore, I&amp;#39;m buying a short etf on the Bund market&lt;/p&gt;

491,,ValueInvesting,"**Valuation:** **Undervalued**

**Investment Thesis:**

* Sixth Street is a business development company out of San Francisco and invests in both debt and equity.
* Sixth street has a TMM revenue of $315.16M, a TTM EBITDA of $214.5M, and a market cap of $1.58B.
* On the lowest end, the potential upside for this investment would be 9.1%, however according to my valuation an upside between 28.8-31.6% is more likely.
* With Sixth Street recently beating their earnings estimate, being upgraded by multiple analysts, and recent insider buying the future is looking good for Sixth Street.

**Company Overview:**

Sixth Street Specialty Lending Inc. is a business development company based out of San Francisco, California. Sixth Street provides senior secured loans, mezzanine debt, non-control structured equity, and common equity with a focus on organic growth, acquisitions, market/product expansion, restructuring, recapitalizations, and refinancing.

Sixth Street seeks out mid-market cap companies ($50M-$1B) located in the USA in the following industries: business services, software/technology, healthcare, energy, consumer/retail, manufacturing, industrials, education, and specialty finance. Sixth street also looks for companies with an EBITDA between $10-250M (average EBITDA is $41M).

In total, Sixth Street has invested in 68 companies, with an average transaction size of $35M. Their portfolio of diversified investments has grown to over $50B AUM (March 2021).

Most of the debt that Sixth street invests into is not rated by any rating agencies, however if they were Sixth Street believes it would be rated at BBB (by Standard and Poor’s) and would be classified as “junk debt”. This kind of debt offers a higher yield (return) to investors because there is a larger credit risk (risk of the company offering these bonds to go bankrupt and not be able to pay investors out) involved. However, Sixth street is able to make consistent returns on this debt as a result of them hedging against their debt (call protection).

Sixth Street is able to generate their revenues through interest income from the investments that they hold in their portfolio. Furthermore, they make income off of dividends, special dividends, capital gains, and other fees that are not as steady sources of income as their interest income.

Sixth street classifies their investments risk on a scale of 1 to 5. On their scale 1 means that there are no concerns about the underlying company’s (who’s bonds Sixth Street holds) financial performance or ability to meet bond payments, these investments are reviewed monthly. Alternatively, on their scale a 5 means that the underlying company is currently/expected to be defaulting on their bond payments, and are of poor financial health, these investments are reviewed bi-monthly. Only 3.6% of Sixth Streets portfolio is invested into debt/equities that are classified as a 3 or above on their riskiness scale.

**Investment Information:**

*Financial Information:*

Sixth Street has a TMM revenue of $315.16M, a TTM EBIT of $214.5M, a market cap of $1.58B and has a forward dividend of 7.36%.

Sixth Street has $2.4B in total assets, which translates into a net asset value per share of $16.47. This is 24.3% lower than the current share price and it would not make sense if the share price were to fall below this point as the value per share would be lower than the asset value per share.

The net income, asset value and distributions per share add up to a value of $18.99/share. This is 12.73% below what $TSLX is currently trading at and serves as a point of support, which may be observed in the “investment plan” section of this report.

Sixth Street has an annualized ROE on their Adjusted net investment income of 13.3%, and an annualized ROE on their adjusted net income of 22.1% for Q1 2021.

100% of Sixth Street’s debt investments (49% of their portfolio) are at a floating rate, meaning it moves up and down with the performance of the financial markets. This floating rate has served them very well over the past year, however there is more risk with a floating rate, especially if the sentiment in the market turns negative.

*Valuation Information:*

*EBIT growth rate:*

I found the EBIT growth rate on Stockopedia, in which they estimated that it is 9.3%

*Interest Expense Decrease Rate:*

I used the annual decrease rate of Sixth Street’s interest expense between 2016-2020, which came out to be an annual decrease of 14.97%.

*Tax Rate:*

I found Sixth Street’s tax rate in one of their SEC filings. They reported that their tax rate was 21%.

*WACC:*

I found Sixth Streets WACC on Tracktak, which provides information on some key metrics of companies that can be used when conducting a DCF model.

*Competition:*

Some of Sixth Street’s closest competitors can be found in the comparable analysis. These competitors are all based out of the USA and are of similar market cap, these companies include BlackRock TCP Capital Corp. ($TCPC), Pennant Park Floating Rate Capital ($PFLT). TriplePoint Venture Growth BDC Corp. ($TPVG), Fidus Investment Corp. ($FDUS), and Newtek Business Services Corp. ($NEWT).

**Investment Plan and Valuation:**

*Investment Valuation:*

In order to value GCBC I used a combination of a DCF analysis and a comparable analysis.

*DCF:*

The figures I used in this model and why I used them can be found above under the “valuation information” section of this report. With the being said, my DCF model arrived at an estimated fair value of $28.03/share, which implies an upside of 28.82%. To further investigate this valuation, I underwent a comparable analysis in an attempt to validate the figure achieved through the DCF model.

*Comparable Analysis – P/S:*

In this analysis I compared Sixth Street’s price to sales ratio (P/S) to their publicly traded competitors listed above under the “competition” section. All of the comparable companies are based in the USA, provide similar services, and are of similar market caps. With that being said, the P/S comparable found that Sixth Street is currently undervalued, and the estimated fair value is $23.74/share, which implies a share price increase of 9.10%.

*Comparable Analysis – P/E:*

In this analysis I compared Sixth Street’s price to earnings ratio (P/E) to their publicly traded competitors. The P/E analysis found that the fair value for $TSLX should be $28.63/share, which implies an upside of 31.58% This analysis confirms the results in the DCF and hints at these levels being more likely than the price achieved through the P/S comparable.

*Investment Plan:*

Any entrance into a position in $TSLX would be the best if bought between $21-22/share.

If the price dropped past this $21 level, I would exit my position and look for a re-entry at $18.99/share, and if this doesn’t hold my last point of re-entry would be between $16.26-16.47/share.

However, if the stock reaches the $28.03 level, I will look to sell my shares and close out the position.

**Catalysts:**

* Any financial reports can serve as a catalyst for this stock.
   * This is especially true if the financial markets are performing good due to Sixth Streets 100% floating rate on their debt investments.
* Financial markets performing good (for reasons previously mentioned).

**Risks:**

* Poor performance in the financial markets can lead to a decreased yield rate on Sixth Street’s debt investments
   * This would appear on the earnings reports and would decrease Sixth Streets revenues.
* Sixth Streets level 5 risk on their debt investments
   * Although they only make up 0.9% of their total debt portfolio, theses companies have a good chance of going bankrupt and thus not being able to pay their bond/debt obligations to Sixth Street (decreased revenue on financial statements).

Hi All

Just wanted to ask a question, I was rereading the chapter in Damodaran's Valuation book on valuing financial services firms as I was trying to do a valuation of a discount broker. 

Reading thru it, the chapter says to use either the Dividend discount method, the excess return method, cashflow to equity, asset based valuations or relative valuations. 

Just wanted to ask, what is everyone's preferred method? and why?  

The idea of FCFE really made sense to me while valuing normal firms as there seemed to be this idea of ""gravity"" of the cash flows to which the firm's value would eventually gravitate towards. 

Looking at the balance sheets of discount brokers like Interactive brokers, as is written in the book, it varies wildly. 

I tried to look up the dividends paid by a mature broker such as Charles Schwab but their payout ratio and dividend was low, so unlike a bank, I wasn't sure if that was going to be the highest payout they could achieve. So using the dividend method didn't seem that great

In short, I guess the dividend, excess and cash flow to equity all required me to make some estimates and that made me think of using a relative valuation, but then that lacks that 'gravity' of cash flows. 

Thanks so much!",t2_nbnq9,False,,0,False,Valuing a financial services firm,[],r/ValueInvesting,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_ne7ejy,False,dark,1.0,,public,3,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Discussion,False,3,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1621257116.0,text,6,,,text,self.ValueInvesting,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi All&lt;/p&gt;

479,,ValueInvesting,"Hi guys,

So this is probably a dumb question but I was obsessed with value investing when I was like 14-15 and read all the classic books.

&amp;#x200B;

Then as I've grown older (18) I stopped investing myself completely and just put it all in a few index funds. My reason is that because I have no experience in business I have no competitive edge over anyone when it comes to investing, so I'm better off generalising rather than specialising. I also wanted to enjoy my childhood a bit and I figured to really invest with an advantage I'll need to spend a considerable amount of time researching inefficient markets etc.

Additionally I have a very limited knowledge of accounting, but in the next 4 years I'm doing a degree apprenticeship in accounting with a big 4 accounting firm in audit, so I'll learn a bit about accounting and I'll be exposed to a variety of businesses (hopefully).

&amp;#x200B;

But I feel like I'm missing out with investing. I see all my friends who don't really have an idea about crypto doubling their money and bragging about it. I also think I have a passion for it, but I keep doubting myself that I'd be able to beat the market with such little experience.

&amp;#x200B;

But, I simply cannot find resources online to understand how companies can have negative equity and be good buys. For example, American Airlines had negative equity and that was because it was in the shitter and issued a ton of debt. On the other side of the coin, Verisign, a value AND Buffett darling, was a huge value play but has negative equity right now? If I had to guess, it was because of massive share buybacks.

Then, for LMT for example, a beautofil company by DCF which I have analyzed since it’s 320 dip and now it’s at 390 (and I expect it to climb to at least mid 400s). However, it’s tangible book value taking goodwill out… it’s negative.

How can these companies be good buy with not only low book value… but NEGATIVE book value?

Please help me understand this one part of the balance sheet.",t2_a1ghhsm7,False,,0,False,Can someone help explain to me how companies with negative equity/tangible book value can still be great investments?,[],r/ValueInvesting,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_ndexwf,False,dark,1.0,,public,8,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Discussion,False,8,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1621162629.0,text,6,,,text,self.ValueInvesting,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi guys.&lt;/p&gt;

505,,ValueInvesting,"Lately I’ve been thinking a lot about goodwill on the balance sheet and it’s implications for return on capital metrics - in turn projected growth rates.

The way I’ve thought about it, if a company mainly grows organically I will disregard goodwill in for example ROIC calculations. If its growth is mainly M&amp;A driven I will account for it. Since companies often change long-term growth strategies and use a mix of both methods it creates issues when modeling.

Today I meant to post it here and accidentally post it in [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/). (facepalm) I thought about deleting it, but what the hell, I'm going to cross-post and see the disparity in the comments.

tldr, I'm having a crisis of confidence in buy-and-hold index investing strategy

**Backstory:**

I'm 38 and live in the USA. I'm employed, and I make the median national income. I want to accrue wealth over the long term. I don't know that I have an accurate understanding of my risk tolerance. I think generally I am very cautious. Before yesterday I was about 70% equities, 15 bonds, 15 cash. I just sold off a lot of my stock. I'm waiting for the account to settle to see my new allocation, but I'm certainly under 50% stocks at this time. I have no debts.

I have been a buy &amp; hold index fund investor for the 20 years of my adult life. It always sort of bothered me that I didn't understand the underlying mechanisms of the markets I was investing in. At some point in the last decade I learned about the Schiller p/e index and thought ""hmm, this doesn't seem good..."" I read *Random Walk,* and I think I understood most of it.

**The Bug Out:**

Recently, I heard a Grantham interview and read some Hussman, and their gloomy prognostication really struck a chord with my natural inclination towards pessimism. They say current prices are unthethered from the underlying assets and and that this is true across all sectors of the market. My friends and the forums are full people throwing money at speculative investments (currency, SPAC, etc). My elders are telling me to blindly invest in an index fund and forget about it, because 'historic returns, don't miss the market's big days, it worked for them, etc.'

My armchair diagnosis is that there are a lot of people like me that are blindly investing in broad index funds that could care less about the underlying value of the assets as long as the price keeps going up. I suspect at some time in the future we'll look back and see that index funds were a craze like any other and laugh at the certainly we currently feel that these assets will return 6-8% on average until the end of time. Looking at you Vanguard (who recently told me that a 'normal asset allocation' was 90-95% stocks...hmm). I also think we'll look back and see that the last trick the boomers played on us was propping up their asset valuations with Fed policy and leaving us to hold the bag.

Worst of all, it doesn't seem like anyone I speak these concerns to (friends, family, investment advisors) is really taking them seriously or even hearing them. Am I turning into a flat-earther? Is the king wearing any clothes?

**What Now?**

I've been told you shouldn't try to time the market, and I've read the explainers about how I'm likely to mistime by selling below the peak, buying before the trough, and missing out on gains while out of the market. Frankly, I'm at a point where I don't believe in the market at all. Is not believing in the market at all the same as timing it?

I've heard that market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent. I've also read that by definition there is never greater certainty in the market than the day before the bubble pops.

I'm not sure I can just put all of my money in an index fund and sleep at night. I have the following questions. Have some of you had a bug-out like I'm having now and that led you to value investing? Do you still believe in index funds in this current market? The knowledge requirements to be a value investor seem much higher than for an index-fund investor. It's crazy intimidating. Do I just start reading your investment bibles and leave my money on the sidelines until I understand how make investment decisions in individual companies?

tldr2; I am questioning the fundamentals of my buy-and-hold index fund approach to investing. What the hell do I do?

In a recent episode of Truth or Skepticism, to put it in a nutshell Sosnoff went off that the Buffet and value investor types are irrelevant and to dump all dividend stocks. His argument was, that everything is priced for growth and to make money in the future you need to value companies by their ability to grow and disrupt since the market is moving towards pricing on speculation instead of fundamentals. He claimed companies can disrupt and take over industries so fast now, its pointless owning anything dividend paying or slow growth. He said traditional fund managers are dying breed like how floor traders where put out of existence by the changing of the markets. Gen Z and Millennials want explosive growth and speculation, no one is going to be looking for a dividend anymore. CEOs acting on behalf of this new wave of investors wanting growth will cut back on dividend strategies.

I have some serious issues with this. Foremost, value investing is a philosophy and art. It is not something you learn from a formula. That is the greatest misconception. The ""Value"" index is just a stock screen. No real value investor will put money in a security after just running a stock screen. It requires hours of analysis of management reports, following cash flow, looking at financials to form an opinion on a security. Its very qualitative work. Its not an asset pricing model where you can plug in features you like and get stocks you should invest in.

Going along with this, there is no true way to value a stock, every value investor may use different methodology. Even Graham himself admitted late in his career his earlier methods of security analysis have been largely corrected by market competition. Buffet has also said the meaning of Value has changed as market structure has changed. At is core all value investing is just about buying securities you believe to be undervalued. Undervalued can mean different things to different people depending on how you do your security analysis. Buffet owns Apple and Snowflake, but people who believe value investing is only buying low PE ratio companies have it wrong. Sosnoff argued volatility will be higher than ever in the future. This seems preposterous to say markets being determined more by behavioral finance and volatile swings does not help value investors. Its the very thing Value investors benefit from. So what if we now price companies by growth multiples.

* [**Stock Tracker &amp; Analysis Spreadsheet**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10MRjupIWNNAO4fdKkgW9QM_IUpPrduHtKz_JiS8JUUA/edit#gid=1116024769)

**The spreadsheet consists of two sheets:**

1. **Tracker:** A watchlist to track stocks and automatically pull financial ratios and data.
2. **Fundamental Analysis:** A way to automatically pull financial statement data, ratios and metrics for analysis.

Everything is **automated**, the only things you have to change are the **tickers** and **data points** you want to pull.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Open it, go to File and click Make a Copy**
2. **Follow all of the instructions on the ""Guide"" tab**

**Use the sheet in this way:**

1. Add new tickers to column A of staticData
2. Sort column A of staticData by A-Z each time you add a new ticker
3. Add the ticker you want to analyze to A1 of fundamentalAnalysis in UPPERCASE

If you end up adding new rows to Tracker or staticData you'll need to    make  sure the formulas are applied to each column, do this like you would in  Excel, drag the cells down.

525,,ValueInvesting,"Hey guys I’m new to this and have a few basic questions: 

1) When it comes to estimated FCF growth what’s the point of first estimating revenues (if you only have a couple years of revenue estimates from analysts), and then FCF as a percentage of net income (which you get from a percentage of revenue) rather than just slapping growth rates onto FCF? Idk why but I’m brain farting hard on realizing why this is necessary.

2)For required rate of return do you calculate WACC and use that? Can you just use CAPM?

3) The farther out that you project FCF means that the terminal value will naturally be higher and you have more years of expected FCF that will be added up.....so doesn’t this naturally increase valuation by just doing more years of EFCF? (Example projecting 4 years instead of 10). What are the advtanges/disadvantages of this?

4) discount factor= (1+required rate return%)^n ? Also terminal value is discounted the same as last year EFCF?

Is it dangerous to use higher perpetual growth rates &gt;3%?

544,,ValueInvesting,"I've been looking for a deep value play for a while and after reading the little book of value investing and applying practices covered within the book I came across this diamond.

The company began operations as a microbrewery of beers in 1980. On August 6, 2004, it changed its name from Boulder Acquisitions, Inc. to China Digital Wireless, Inc., marketing in pager and mobile phone distribution until May 10, 2007, when the company completely ceased these businesses. In December 2006, the company extended its business to the energy saving and recycling industry. On March 8, 2007, it finally changed its name to current China Recycling Energy Corporation.

The company manufactures various energy-generation projects from the byproducts of industrial processes, such as blast furnace top gas recovery turbine (TRT) unit (using exhaust pressure and heat emitted from industrial processes), waste gas power generation (WGPG) systems, combined cycle power plant (CCPP) systems; biomass power generation systems (BMPG); and wate heat  power generation (WHPG) systems.

The company has a strategic cooperation agreement for three-year exclusive support in business development with CGN Energy Service Co., Ltd. The subsidiaries of the company are: Sifang Holdings, Huahong New Energy Technology Co., Ltd. (Huahong) and Shanghai TCH ( with three subsidiaries: Xi’an TCH Energy Technology Company, Ltd (Xi’an TCH) and Xingtai Huaxin Energy Tech Co., Ltd. (Huaxin), and Xi’an TCH’s subsidiary Erdos TCH Energy Saving Development Co., Ltd (Erdos TCH)).

In October 2011, China Recycling Energy Corporation completed an acquisition of a 12-megawatt biomass power generation system from Shenqiu Yuneng Thermal Power Co., Ltd.

In June 2011, the system of the project ZhongBao was sold to and leased back from Cinda Financial Leasing Co., Ltd

As a future play, personally as I see resources drying up and coal and oil being phased out. The world is still not in a full position for the transition fully over to solar, wind and tidal technologies. Therefore technology such as biomass energy generation from the burning of recycled waste is a viable option which creates a use for waste accumulating on landfill sites and can help provide the transition from fossil fuels and provide energy for the installation of green infrastructure.

As a value play; $CREG is currently trading at a price to book ratio of 0.2 that states that this company has 5 times more cash on hand in assets than it is currently trading at on the stock market.

It has a current ratio of 2.67 which shows that it can pay its short term debts off 2.67 times over with current cash on hand.

The company currently has $92,000,000 worth of assets and if we looked at cash per a share this stock is at $24.59 it is currently trading at $7.90 as we speak so if you want to 3x in the next year this is a deep value play.",t2_868zxua2,False,,0,False,$CREG my value investment play,[],r/ValueInvesting,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_naw8y2,False,dark,0.8,,public,6,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Stock Analysis,False,6,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1620874192.0,text,6,,,text,self.ValueInvesting,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been looking for a deep value play for a while and after reading the little book of value investing and applying practices covered within the book I came across this diamond.&lt;/p&gt;

Note this stock is not for the faint hearted. Balls of steel is required for this one.

GEO is a REIT focused on private prisons and mental health facilities across the globe.

Currently the stock is down more than 80% from its high. I would almost describe this as a Peter Lynch/ Early day Buffett play.

The main argument against GEO group is its relatively high debt. Sure it's high but that alone won't tell you if the debt is a current liability for the business.

Unlike its peers it is able to service that debt. (Refer to the interest coverage ratio). For reference greater than one on the interest coverage ratio means that the business is meeting its interest payments whilst also paying down the debt.

Some of its counterparts may have lower debt but they unable or barley meeting their interest payments.

This also reiterates a point that debt alone doesn't tell the full picture for any company. What you don't want is a company highly in debt and not meeting their interest payments. Nor should you strive for a company that has lower debt but it is not meeting its payments.

Based on Future Earnings for this year, GEO group would pull in a almost ridiculous 17.53% earnings yield. For reference Citibank the most undervalued bank atm, IMO. Trades at about 11% earnings yield and most of then big tech stocks trading in the 3% range.

The street estimates have GEO at around $15, compared to the $6 it currently trades at. (If you do care for analyst estimates).

Over the last five years net income has remained very stable. Income acts very similar to that of WM. No ridiculous highs nor lows. A defensive company in its own right.

Accountants do number gymnastics a lot of the time to make their income growth look pretty. It just happens to be GEO is not one of those.

GEO faces two problems private prisons aren't exactly popular in the public eye and present a moral issue for many people. I'll let your own morals decide you opinion on the stock.

If you need a safety margin for the risk that GEO group presents, you've got one. The book value for GEO group is currently at 913 million, whilst the the market cap sits at 728m. A 20% margin of safety exactly.

The stock faces high amounts of pressure on the short side. With 38 million shares sold short or 33% of the float. This is by no means a popular stock by Wall Street standards.

However, Q1 results were impressive with expectations set about $0.21 EPS vs actual $0.28 EPS.

Michael Burry did add it a few months ago, not sure if he still holds though.

The main argument against this purchase is Joe Biden's executive order on reducing the use of private prisons. Question is the Government really in the position to build their own prisons?

Hello Value Investors!

The first thought that comes to many people's minds when they think of value investing is investing in beat-up, down-trending companies in hope for a turnaround, or companies that are ""cheap"" such as those with a low P/E ratio, but this actually isn't the case much of the time. As quoted by Charlie Munger, value investing is just purchasing shares in a company that is trading below its intrinsic value.

In the linked video, I provide my qualitative and quantitative analysis over Microsoft, using the discounted cash flow (DCF) model and future earnings multiple approach to determine what I consider to be a fair value for the company.

Charlie Munger has described Warren Buffett  as a ""Learning Machine"" several times. There is not doubt that to be  successful in investing one needs to be continually learning. Talking  with several investors, most of them dismiss technical analysis and  trading. While I don't want to invest on these principles, I think one  can learn a great deal from them. Just like we learn from Buffett, Li  Lu, Klarman or Munger, we can learn from the best in trading. In  commodities that is without a doubt Commodities Corporation.

## Commodities Corporation

Founded  in 1969 by Helmut Weymar and Amos Hostetter Sr. with an investment of  $2.5 million, they became one of the most successful trading companies  to ever exist.

At the beginning of 1980 Commodities Corp. had a  capital of $30 million. In that year alon they made $42 million trading  profits. Even after ridiculous bonuses to their employees, they posted a  net income of $17 million - more than 58 of the Fortune 500 companies.  They had a mixture of investments in different commodity companies and  speculated with commodity futures.  
In 1997 they were sold to Goldman Sachs having $1.7 billion under management.

Not  only were they incredible successful but several of the world's most  revered traders like Mike Marcus, Bruce Kovner, Grenville Craig, Willem  Kooyoker, Ed Seykota, Louis Bacon, Jack Schwager (author of the Market  Wizard series) and of course Paul Tudor Jones either started or worked  for Commodities Corporation.  
One of the things that made them so  successful were the principles laid out by one of it's founders who  tragically died in a car accident in 1977, Amos Hostetter

## A successful speculator's approach to commodity trading.

As  a lot of the principles only apply to trading, I will only take what  can be used as an investor. The original document can be found [here](https://3jhb8o3jvg7f2j47gb10wfzs-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Amos-Hotsetter-Commodity-Corps-2.pdf).

Hostetter's trading philosophy simplified is this:

* Try to acquire every bit of fundamental information available. Read extensively.
* Simultaneously,  post daily charts on commodities and develop a feel for trends. Follow  the fundamentals in your trading, but only if and as long as the charts  do not cast a negative vote.

While the second principle  doesn't apply to a pure value investing approach, the first principle is  remarkably similar to a quote from Warren Buffett:

&gt;I  insist on a lot of time being spent, almost every day, to just sit and  think. That is very uncommon in American business. I read and think. So I  do more reading and thinking, and make less impulse decisions than most  people in business.”

### Money Management

One of  the most important rules in trading and investing is to not lose money.  Hostetter was aware of his own fallibility (remember even Warren  Buffett made several investing mistakes) and tried to protect himself by  creating trading rules. ""Take care of your losses and the profits will  take care of themselves"" is again something that is very similar to the  principles outlines in ""The Intelligent Investor"" as margin of safety.  Hostetter was also quite strict in terms of diversification for a  trader, never betting more than 10% on a single trade.

### Fundamental approach

After looking at the balance sheet and statistics of the given commodity, Hostetter would ask very basic questions:

* Will production exceed the consumption this season? -&gt; Bearish premise
* Will consumption exceed production this season? -&gt; Bullish premise

While  the initial premise will afterwards be defined by other considerations  such as weather or economic conditions, it shouldn't be the fixed  opinion. Due to the quick market movements one needs to have the *flexibility of thinking*. You can never know what the future will bring and one should try to protect oneself from potential surprises.  
Hostetter  of course would use the tools available to him as a trader, like  scatter diagrams, charts and statistics, but he kept his basic set of  fundamental tools quite simple.

### Technical approach

While  many of the principles like trend following or chart reading outlined in  this chapter don't apply as a value investor there are some that do.  
Patience  was a main one from Hostetter. Just like Warren Buffett only hits the  pitches that are best, so does Amos Hostetter. It is far better to miss  an opportunity, than to jump in without a clear plan.

### Hostetter computerized trading system

While  in his 70's, Amos Hostetter learned programming in order to automate a  lot of his trading process. While this is often not a possibility for a  retail investors such as myself due to either a lack of programming  knowledge or the cost of data, one can still create principles that  automate a lot of the analysis, such as the debt levels one is  comfortable with, or eliminating industries due to lack of knowledge or  interest. 

### Some general principle and market maxims

* Take care of your losses and your profits will take care of themselves.
* When in doubt get out. Don't gamble. Be sure that doubt is fundamental not due to feelings.
* All trends take a long time to work themselves out. Be patient.

### Observation by Hostetter

I have omitted some of the points that purely apply to technical analysis or trading.

#### Dangers in trading caused by human nature

1. Fear - Fearful of profit and one acts too soon.
2. Hope - Hope in the forces against one.
3. Lack of confidence in one's own judgment.
4. Never cease to do your own thinking.
5. A man must not swear eternal allegiance to either the bear or the bull side. His concern lies in being right.
6. The individual fails to stick to facts.
7. People believe what pleases them to believe.

#### Don'ts

* Don't sacrifice your position for fluctuations.
* Don't expect the market to end in a blaze of glory. Look out for warnings.
* Don't imagine that something that has sold at 150 is cheap at 130.
* Don't try to make an average from a losing game.

#### Suggestions

* Experience must teach. Follow it invariably.
* When something happens on which you don't count when your plans were made, try to utilize that opportunity.
* Stick to facts only and govern your actions accordingly.
* If a market doesn't act right, don't touch it.

## Thoughts

As  a value investor, I often thought traders are just gambling their money  away. Reading this manual opened my eyes, that they just use a  different approach to their investment process. Not only that, but one  can learn a lot from their thinking. Knowing how traders and trading  professional react to certain market developments can open opportunities  as a a value investor or help you avoid a mistake. Either way, it seems  that learning different market philosophies can only help in the long  term.

* $100 million net cash on balance sheet (vs. $500 million market cap)
* 6x to 8x P/E
* $179 million in order backlogs at the end of March

**Apr-June 2021 Quarter Forward Guidance**  


* \+40% to +50% YoY sales growth (+51% to +62% excluding Octane Fitness), \~$170 million in revenue
* 250,000 JRNY subscribers by March 2022
* $12 million to $14 million annual CAPEX with majority earmarked for JRNY subscription service 

Blowout quarter that was even stronger than Q4 2020, which I believe most people suspected would be peak earnings for many ""pandemic winners.""  


The business itself has continued to perform extremely well. The majority of market participants have been extremely skeptical as to whether Nautilus was a one-hit pandemic winner. In contrast, all of my research indicated that at-home fitness was here to permanently stay for a large part of the population. Nautilus had also permanently transformed their product portfolio and business model (JRNY connected fitness service) to capture this growth in the market.

  
Q2 2021 is the first true ""pandemic YoY comp"" to gauge how the business will perform in a more normal world. The fact that Nautilus has guided to 40% to 50% YoY growth (and even higher excluding divested commercial business) means the company's ability to grow in the post-pandemic world is becoming clearly evident. The order backlog of $179 million (at the end of a $206 million sales quarter) is also indicative of this.

  
Margins and profitability will definitely be pressured for the next 1 to 2 quarters due to higher commodity prices, global chip shortages, and increased marketing and investment in JRNY. However, I don't see a particularly difficult path for them to hit $2.50 to $3.00 in EPS this year, which means the stock currently trades at around 6x to 8x earnings. 

  
This is quite cheap, especially considering that net cash is 20% of market cap, and the company is in the process of complementing its equipment business with predictable, high margin software revenue from the JRNY connected fitness subscription.

568,,ValueInvesting,"Warren Buffett has frequently said, ""Don't invest in a business you can't understand.""  Peter Lynch has said, ""Invest in what you know.""

They seem like they are saying the same thing.  Technically, they are not.  Buffett's is negative advice, telling you what not to do.  Lynch's is positive advice, indicating an action you should take.  They draw on a similar principle: that the individual investor can have personal knowledge to inform his investing choices, knowledge that Wall St institutions may lack or not even consider.  This is the knowledge that allows the individual investor to know risk and value properly and ""beat the market.""

So who is right: Buffet or Lynch?  The answer depends on where you are in your maturity as an investor.  Obviously, what you know/understand is gradient.  Buffett has been investing for 70 years in different sectors.  He's seen entire industries emerge, grow to gargantuan heights, and then fade into obsolescence.  He's lived through several market cycles, crashes.  He lived when the dollar was tied to gold, the OPEC-induced stagflaton, when globalization began, and so on.  If there's something he doesn't understand after all of this, of course he's not going to invest in it.

But none of us starts out knowing everything.  Buffett learned from Benjamin Graham but had to improve on the methods of his master over time.  He couldn't have waited to invest until he knows everything he knows now.  Otherwise, he wouldn't have been able to compound his wealth.  If we try to harmonize Buffett's line with Lynch's one might get: ""Invest in what you know the best, and never invest in what you know the least.""

Even if you don't understand the business qualitatively, it's hard to ignore *consistently* good numbers.  If the market just hasn't noticed it because it's not a meme stock, then good for you.
2. **The Essence: Product, Management, Personal Touch.**  The numbers should always come before this, but this lets you know if past performance can be a good indicator of future performance.  Peter Lynch noted that Toys R Us, in addition to having good numbers, had a concept that he could imagine being easily scaled across America.  He was a customer at Dunkin' Donuts, and he knew their respect for keeping the coffee fresh meant that they took the customer seriously.  For you BRK holders, we know Buffett's attitude toward stocks and his philosophy that informs acquisitions.  I don't need to know everything about what Berkshire does; I know the attitude that has driven their performance and that he has developed a unique culture in that company.

Not all assumptions will hold true.  This gets us to a related quote by Charles Munger: ""Diversification is for the know-nothing investor.""  This isn't exactly an insult.  Munger knows what investments are great or not and knows enough from his experience to be all-in on only a few companies.  It can take time to know that, so concentrated portfolios are, in large part, something you can do as you analyze your investments, learn from your mistakes, and concentrate your capital in the best companies you've acquired.  Invest in what you know; focus on what you know better.",t2_trph7,False,,0,False,Discussion on Knowledgeable Investing,[],r/ValueInvesting,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_na1qcc,False,dark,1.0,,public,12,1,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Discussion,False,12,,False,True,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1620781149.0,text,6,,,text,self.ValueInvesting,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warren Buffett has frequently said, &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t invest in a business you can&amp;#39;t understand.&amp;quot;  Peter Lynch has said, &amp;quot;Invest in what you know.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They seem like they are saying the same thing.  Technically, they are not.  Buffett&amp;#39;s is negative advice, telling you what not to do.  Lynch&amp;#39;s is positive advice, indicating an action you should take.  They draw on a similar principle: that the individual investor can have personal knowledge to inform his investing choices, knowledge that Wall St institutions may lack or not even consider.  This is the knowledge that allows the individual investor to know risk and value properly and &amp;quot;beat the market.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So who is right: Buffet or Lynch?  The answer depends on where you are in your maturity as an investor.  Obviously, what you know/understand is gradient.  Buffett has been investing for 70 years in different sectors.  He&amp;#39;s seen entire industries emerge, grow to gargantuan heights, and then fade into obsolescence.  He&amp;#39;s lived through several market cycles, crashes.  He lived when the dollar was tied to gold, the OPEC-induced stagflaton, when globalization began, and so on.  If there&amp;#39;s something he doesn&amp;#39;t understand after all of this, of course he&amp;#39;s not going to invest in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But none of us starts out knowing everything.  Buffett learned from Benjamin Graham but had to improve on the methods of his master over time.  He couldn&amp;#39;t have waited to invest until he knows everything he knows now.  Otherwise, he wouldn&amp;#39;t have been able to compound his wealth.  If we try to harmonize Buffett&amp;#39;s line with Lynch&amp;#39;s one might get: &amp;quot;Invest in what you know the best, and never invest in what you know the least.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; we know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Numbers: Low Debt, Earnings, Cash Flows, Dividends.&lt;/strong&gt;  It does not matter that you like the product if the business sucks or if the price is wrong, relative to the numbers.  I recently told a friend that Tesla may well be the greatest business of all time, but if you overpay for a share in it it, you lose money, because that&amp;#39;s the definition of overpaying.

&amp;#x200B;

I've condensed what I believe are the most important points about this company.

Firstly, it aims to become “non-prime lending specialist”. This is a relatively untapped market and is mainly serviced by small unstructured companies like pawn shops.

It claims that it can continue to grow with non-prime customers as they have gathered enough intelligence to be able to offer products catered to this market.

&amp;#x200B;

**3-Tiered Growth Strategy**

• Re-engage with former customers

• Restart traditional direct mail campaigns

• Expand new partner channels *(Growing fastest)*

&amp;#x200B;

**The P/E ratio went down from 8.14 from 12/2020 to 3.66 on 03/2021 as the EPS went from 0.49 to 1.02  due to the jump in earnings as well as the repurchase of shares** 

&amp;#x200B;

In January 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors **authorized a $25 million increase to the Company’s existing $30 million common stock repurchase program, providing for the repurchase of up to $55 million of the Company’s common stock through July 31, 2024.** During the first quarter of 2021, the Company purchased $10.8 million of common shares (2.5 million common shares) under the Company's previously approved common stock repurchase program or roughly 6.5% of common shares outstanding at the beginning of 2021. As of March 31, 2021, the Company has repurchased approximately **23% of all common shares issued and outstanding since August 2019 under this common stock repurchase program.**

&amp;#x200B;

**If the share price goes upto 5$ and the company repurchases at this price, they will buy back another 11 million shares and the P/E as of 03/2021 would be 2.59!!!!**

The current share price is 3.3 as of 05/11/2021 and the bottom would be protected by the share repurchase program as the management believes that the stock price is severely underpriced.",t2_a1d17k5d,False,,0,False,Elevate Credit ($ELVT) DD,[],r/ValueInvesting,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_n9y716,False,dark,1.0,,public,4,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Stock Analysis,False,4,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1620771925.0,text,6,,,text,self.ValueInvesting,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elevate is company based in Texas and provides credit to &lt;strong&gt;non-prime consumers&lt;/strong&gt; in the United States.

&lt;p&gt;• Restart traditional direct mail campaigns&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• Expand new partner channels &lt;em&gt;(Growing fastest)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The P/E ratio went down from 8.14 from 12/2020 to 3.66 on 03/2021 as the EPS went from 0.49 to 1.02  due to the jump in earnings as well as the repurchase of shares&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors &lt;strong&gt;authorized a $25 million increase to the Company’s existing $30 million common stock repurchase program, providing for the repurchase of up to $55 million of the Company’s common stock through July 31, 2024.&lt;/strong&gt; During the first quarter of 2021, the Company purchased $10.8 million of common shares (2.5 million common shares) under the Company&amp;#39;s previously approved common stock repurchase program or roughly 6.5% of common shares outstanding at the beginning of 2021. As of March 31, 2021, the Company has repurchased approximately &lt;strong&gt;23% of all common shares issued and outstanding since August 2019 under this common stock repurchase program.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If the share price goes upto 5$ and the company repurchases at this price, they will buy back another 11 million shares and the P/E as of 03/2021 would be 2.59!!!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current share price is 3.3 as of 05/11/2021 and the bottom would be protected by the share repurchase program as the management believes that the stock price is severely underpriced.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

Based on the three metrics the companies can be ranked in the following order C, WFC, USB, JPM and BAC.

When you look at Citigroup value is highly noticeable compared to its counterparts. So much so that it currently trades at less than its book value. Almost earning a 12% future income yield, considerably higher than the other big four with most trading in the high 7%’s. 

Citigroup has recently been in a period of change, with large restructuring of its global strategy. Currently they are exiting the consumer banking part of their business in Asia.

Why is the important? This part of the business has been lagging for some time. Letting go of underperforming services is a sign that the new management is taking the business in the right direction. 

They will instead focus on what they call wealth centres i.e. places like Singapore and London to grow their wealth management business. Essentially downsizing from 13 markets to just 4 key markets.

As I stated in my analysis of USB, loan losses do remain a threat however it does seem to be coming to its eventual peak. I would expect the loan losses to start falling by the last quarter of the year.

It suffered one of the larger income losses compared to the other banks. This was reflected in a -43% in net income for 2020. However, the first quarter remained evidently strong reflecting the recovery in the banking system.

Consumer banking makes up around 30% of total revenues and similarly makes up close 30% of net income. The institutional arm of the business reflects most of its business. It also currently has higher margins than the consumer banking arm.

The institutional side was the beneficiary of both high SPAC activity as well as favourable conditions in the market for derivatives, that allowed them to make up for lost activity in fixed income 

So why is Citibank currently trading at such as low valuation?

There are a few reasons. Citibank remained insolvent during the GFC and was bailed by the government. Reflective of its poor decisions in the fixed income market, since then the recovery in the stock has been slow. 

There is certainly a level of distrust in the very banks that brought down the world in 2007 and 2008.

Also, the presence of its last decade failed stress tests but were due in part to qualitative aspects, I.e., unresolved regulatory disputes. Remained an issue in the past.

In 2015 it was able to pass the stress test and resume share buybacks.

Despite these facts when fundamentals are no longer priced into a stock an inefficiency has occurred. Making way for a value play or deep value depending on how you play it.

578,,ValueInvesting,"Good evening,

Impresa Group is the leading Portuguese communications group, operating eight TV channels and the country largest newspaper, the Expresso.

Late last year Impresa also launched the first portuguese language streaming service (OPTO) offering online content from a library of films and television series that can reach hundred millions of people that speak portuguese worldwyde.

This is why I think Impresa (**IPR**.LS - Euronext Lisbon) is the cheapest stock I found:

\- Market Cap of 34M€ (168 millions of shares)

\- 2020 FY Net Profit of 11.2M€ (without extraordinary effects)

\- P/E ratio of 3

\- 2020 FY EBITDA of 31.2M€ **(almost the same of its market cap, ridiculous!)**

\- Net Debt/EBITDA: 4.9 (it’s big, but it's the lowest since 2005 and going down YoY)

\- Market Cap/Revenues: 0.18

\- Revenues started to grow again, in spite of COVID-19 crisis, revenues were higher in 2020 than in 2018.

\- About OPTO (opto.sic.pt), there's no information about the number of subscribers yet, but it will be released soon.

\- Despite no projections or analyst covering the stock, I’m expecting better results for 2021 (revenues over 200M, EBITDA 35-40M, net profit 15-20M and less net debt).

The SEC has requested that we voluntarily provide it with documents and information relating to, among other things, our consolidation policies and practices (including our prior practice of accounting for Cainiao Network as an equity method investee), our policies and practices applicable to related party transactions in general, and our reporting of operating data from the 11.11 global shopping festival. We are voluntarily disclosing this SEC request for information and cooperating with the SEC and, through our legal counsel, have been providing the SEC with requested documents and information. We believe we have fully responded to the SEC’s inquiries. The SEC advised us that the initiation of a request for information should not be construed as an indication by the SEC or its staff that any violation of the federal securities laws has occurred. Our management believes that the risk of loss in connection with this proceeding is currently remote and that this proceeding will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. However, in light of the inherent uncertainties involved in this and similar proceedings, some of which are beyond our control, the risk of loss may become more likely and an adverse outcome could be material to our results of operations or cash flows for any particular reporting period.

&gt;In 2015, we and certain of our current and former officers and directors were named as a defendant in seven putative shareholder class action lawsuits filed in the United States District Courts by shareholders asserting claims pursuant to the U.S. Exchange Act and three putative shareholder class action lawsuits filed in the Superior Court of the State of California by shareholders asserting claims pursuant to the U.S. Securities Act. The lawsuits allege that the registration statement and prospectus filed in connection with our initial public offering and various other public statements contained misrepresentations regarding our business operations and financial prospects, and failed to disclose, among other things, regulatory scrutiny by the SAIC prior to our initial public offering. The District Court lawsuits were centralized in the Southern District of New York under the master caption Christine Asia Co., Ltd. et al. v. Alibaba Group Holding Limited et al., No. 1:15-md-02631-CM (S.D.N.Y.). In June 2016, the Southern District of New York issued

The order held that Plaintiffs failed to plead that Defendants made actionable misstatements or omissions or that Defendants acted with scienter. In December 2017, following an appeal by the plaintiffs, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals issued a summary order vacating the Southern District of New York’s dismissal order and remanding the case to the Southern District of New York for further proceedings. In May 2018, the Southern District of New York certified a class of all persons and/or entities that purchased or otherwise acquired our ADSs or purchased call options or sold put options on our ADSs between September 19, 2014 and January 28, 2015, inclusive, with certain exclusions. On April 29, 2019, we announced that defendants had entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the lawsuits. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, we agreed to pay US$250 million in exchange for a full release of all claims brought in the lawsuit. The settlement agreement expressly provides that the settlement does not constitute an admission or finding that the claims asserted had any merit. On October 16, 2019, the Southern District of New York entered a judgment approving the settlement and dismissing the lawsuit. The California lawsuits were consolidated under the caption Gary Buelow, et al. v. Alibaba Group Holding Limited, et al., No. CIV-535692 (San Mateo Sup. Ct.). In December 2016, the Superior Court sustained our demurrer to the complaint in part and denied it in part. In January 2017, we answered the consolidated complaint, asserting a general denial as to all allegations and setting forth affirmative defenses. In March 2018, plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification, requesting, among other things, that the Superior Court certify a class of all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired our ADSs pursuant or traceable to the Registration Statement issued in connection with our IPO. This motion was not ruled on by the Superior Court. On December 31, 2018, we announced that defendants had entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the consolidated class action lawsuit.

The company had the unfortunate luck of going public at the end of March 2021 and faced a very tough tech IPO market to say the least. Nonetheless, Vizio’s reputation as a hardware company masks its small, but rapidly growing and extremely profitable advertising business that has grown at over 100% a year since it was established in 2018. Taking advantage of its large market share in TVs, the company is finally ramping up its ability to monetize the millions of daily users of its SmartCast operating system (found on every Vizio television). Essentially, Vizio is getting paid every time a user turns on the TV (and more) and is following a template already established by Roku. Vizio sold 17.1 million smart TVs between 2018 and 2020 and grew its active SmartCast accounts from 3.6 to 12.2 million accounts over that same time frame (a strong 70% conversion rate). 

To put the contrasting economics into perspective, in 2020, Vizio’s hardware business had 10% gross margins, contributed to 93% of total sales and 62% of total gross profit, and grew 7% YoY. Meanwhile, its SmartCast platform/advertising business had 76% gross margins (up from 60% in 2018), contributed to only 7% of total sales but 38% of total gross profit, and grew at 132% YoY. The growth in the high margin platform/ad business propelled total net income to expand more than 4x from $23 million in 2019 to $103 million in 2020 ($41 million of which was in Q4 2020 alone). Growth should remain strong for years to come, as the company has barely scratched the surface with monetizing its SmartCast platform.

At its current market cap of $4.6 billion (\~$25 a share), Vizio trades at 2x sales, 20x forward earnings, and has over $300 million in cash with no debt. As investor awareness improves regarding the high growth software platform, the stock's multiple should expand significantly and narrow the valuation gap with peers like Roku. Shares are easily worth 2x to 4x the current price. The company offers investors a compelling opportunity to gain exposure to the connected TV advertising market, which is projected to grow from $9 billion to $28 billion between 2020 and 2025.

582,,ValueInvesting,"**- Company &amp; Investment Overview -**

Betterware de Mexico is a leading direct-to-consumer marketplace and platform business in Mexico that sells home organization and cleaning products. It is the first Mexican company to ever directly list on the NASDAQ. Betterware’s product portfolio falls under 6 categories (ranked according to % of sales): kitchen (35%), home (20%), bathroom (12%), laundry &amp; cleaning (11%), commuting (11%), and bedroom (11%). The company sells its products through a unique two-tier sales model that consists of 59,700+ distributors and 1.2+ million associates with a 20% household penetration across Mexico.

Betterware has 60% gross margins and returns on tangible capital, generates abundant free cash flow, and pays a 4% dividend. The business grew at over 50% annualized over the last 5 years and generated $350 million in revenue and $77 million in net income in 2020. The founding family oversees operations and owns half of the company, a stake worth over $750 million USD. The company is expected to continue growing well above 40% a year for the next several years thanks to a long growth runway remaining in Mexico and nearby Latin American countries. The stock trades at a very undervalued 14x earnings at a $1.7 billion market cap due to lack of investor awareness. We believe the company is worth at least 100% to 150% more.

**- Business History -**

Betterware began as the Mexican subsidiary of the British company Betterware Limited. Betterware Limited sold a variety of household products in the UK and decided to expand into Latin America. Unfortunately, the venture performed poorly because the British parent did not tailor the business model to fit Latin America’s unique cultural and demographic characteristics (which will be explained later). This created the opportunity that led to Luis Campos, Betterware de Mexico’s current chairman and 50% owner, acquiring this subsidiary and establishing it as Betterware de Mexico. Mr. Campos was uniquely positioned to revitalize this distressed company due to his extensive background in consumer goods businesses in Latin America. His storied career included being the former chairman at various multinational corporations, including Hasbro Mexico, Sara Lee Mexico, and Tupperware Americas. Mr. Campos completely reshaped the business to fit Latin American culture and laid the groundwork that enabled the company to achieve its spectacular future results.

Under his leadership, Betterware’s revenue and EBITDA grew over 60-fold and 120-fold, respectively, over the last twenty years (23%+ annualized). In addition, the company’s distribution network grew from 200 distributors to over 59,000 and from 5,000 associates to over 1.2 million. In March 2020, the company went public via special purpose acquisition company. Dr. Martin Werner, the former head of Goldman Sachs’s LatAm investment banking division, led the deal. In its first calendar year as a public company (2020), Betterware grew revenues by 130% and EBITDA by 147%. The business’s growth, profitability, and execution have been stellar under Campos’s oversight. Looking ahead, Betterware is aiming to expand globally, starting with other Latin American countries, including Costa Rica, Panama, Peru, and Colombia.

**- Business Model &amp; Competitive Advantages -**

As mentioned earlier, Betterware employs a direct-to-consumer sales strategy. In contrast, in traditional retail, products move in the following sequence: manufacturer → wholesaler → distributor → retailer → customer. Betterware’s model involves none of these middlemen or external parties between the company and its customers. As a result, the company is able to offer extremely affordable prices across its product portfolio (average item price is $5). Customers order products, and Betterware controls the entire process ranging from manufacturing to distribution (via the distributors and associates) to the final product sale. Betterware designs products in-house, manufactures them in Asia, and delivers them to distributors. Both distributors and associates deliver the products directly to the customer. This allows the company to minimize its shipping and last-mile delivery costs. 

Betterware sells its products through 9 catalogs a year that are published roughly every 6 weeks. The catalog is accessible via a 100-page physical booklet, the e-commerce site ([https://www.betterware.com.mx/mx/es/](https://www.betterware.com.mx/mx/es/)), and the iOS/Android app. The firm is constantly innovating and introduces around 300 new products each year while replacing underperforming products. The e-commerce site launched in December 2020 and helped accelerate sales that month by 301% YoY and EBITDA by 417% YoY.

Products are delivered from the company’s distribution center to the distributor through whom the order was placed. The distributor has groups of associates who work for them, and the associates deliver the products to the customer. Therefore, the company itself has 0 last mile delivery costs, as its distributors and associates deliver the products to the final consumers. This is one key competitive advantage in Mexico due to last-mile delivery costs being exorbitant, especially to rural areas.

Four other factors further solidify Betterware’s competitive position in the market:

First, Betterware offers payment flexibility by accepting both cash and credit. 70% of transactions in Mexico are made in cash, while only 30% are made on credit. In addition, less than a third of Mexicans have a bank account and even less use a debit or credit card. This makes the ability to accept cash important, as well as problematic for many other e-commerce retailers who have attempted expansion in Mexico and Latin America. At the same time, the ability to pay via credit on Betterware’s e-commerce site is also important because it allows the company to have direct exposure to the trend of financial transactions becoming increasingly digital around the world.

Second, the company’s platform continues to grow in its scale and reach over time. The firm has grown at over 20%+ annualized for 2 decades, with annual growth accelerating in the past 5 years in excess of 40%. With 1.3 million total distributors and associates, Betterware products are now sold by nearly 1.5% of Mexico’s working population. As more people continue to buy products, the company is also able to better introduce new items that will be in demand thanks to the ability to analyze the millions of transactions taking place.

Third, the business performs exceptionally well during economic downturns. Many Mexican residents become associates or distributors to earn additional income during a recession. Furthermore, due to the low average product sales price, customers are likely to cut other areas of spending from their budgets before reducing their Betterware purchases. As a result of these two attributes, the business model is extremely resilient to recessions.

Last but not least, Betterware is run by a high quality founder-led management team. The Campos family owns 18,438,770 shares, a 50.1% stake worth over $700 million USD today. They have not sold a single share since the company went public, despite the value of their stake rising from \~$144 million. Additionally, the Campos family takes no compensation directly from the company. Instead, their entire $33 million USD annual income is derived from the company’s dividends. Because of this, the Campos family is aligned with the interests of current shareholders.

**- Cultural &amp; Geographic Relevance -**

Betterware’s business model is tailored to perfectly fit Mexico’s unique cultural and geographical dynamics. For starters, family is one of the most important elements in Mexican society and is an essential safety net of help and protection. Families are typically large, especially in the rural communities that dominate Mexico’s population. Furthermore, decorating and maintaining a home is very important, as family gatherings are a large part of Mexican life.

These characteristics point us back to the two reasons why the British sales model was ineffective. First, their approach was impersonal. Associates were assigned to specific residential neighborhoods and dropped off physical catalogs in every mailbox. Residents could write down their orders and leave it back in the mailbox. Since the associate had no personal connection with these potential customers, this was not an effective strategy. This is why the change in Betterware’s sales model, implemented by Luis Campos, worked so well. As a result, a Betterware associate is usually a customer themselves first, then sells products to family, co-workers, and close friends. Given the strong family ties and loyalty among these groups, many people make a strong effort to order Betterware products through their friends or family members. 

Second, the original product catalog tailored more to the average British consumer rather than those in Mexico. To rectify this, Betterware focused its product portfolio on items that help organize, save space, or maintain a clean home because of the cultural importance of family and the home in Mexico and Latin America.

Thus, Betterware succeeded where its British parent failed, by capitalizing on Mexico’s family-oriented culture and creating a product line that focused on home organization and cleanliness.

**- Valuation -**

Betterware generated $350 million in revenue, $104 million in EBITDA, and $76.5 million in net income. The business also has 60% gross margins, 60% normalized returns on tangible capital, and net cash on the balance sheet. 2021 guidance points to $500 million in revenue, $148 million in EBITDA, and $112 million in net income.

At a $1.4 billion market cap, the stock trades at 12.5x 2021 earnings. This is an incredibly low valuation for a company that has grown at 40%+ annualized for the last 5 years and 135% in 2020. Furthermore, the management team, which has a reputation for being conservative, has guided to 45% revenue growth for 2021. This is likely extremely understated as the business exited 2020 growing at over 300% YoY, and 3rd party sources indicate that growth has remained elevated. The company also announced its annual dividend for 2021 of \~$67 million USD, which is roughly 66% of 2021 free cash flow, based on management’s guidance. With the business growing in excess of 40% a year, the dividend should keep growing annually. A 5% dividend yield is usually found in stable, mature, or distressed companies, not in asset-light platform businesses growing at high rates. Betterware also trades at 50% to 75%+ discounts to other Latin American platform and DTC businesses like MercadoLibre and Tupperware.

Additionally, Betterware has a strong runway to maintain its  growth. First, it only has 20% market share in Mexico and is expanding into surrounding Latin American countries including Guatemala, Panama, Costa Rica, Peru, and Colombia. Second, Betterware only has about 20% wallet share at the moment. The company expects to grow this by introducing new products into the catalog to capture more of a typical family’s spending on home-related items.

Asset-light platform businesses with high growth tend to trade at large multiples and often for good reason. Betterware has all of these characteristics and profitability. It is also returning cash to shareholders via the annual dividend. If we assign even a 30x earnings multiple on Betterware’s 2021 earnings, it is over a $100 stock vs. $38 currently. Even ignoring the 135% revenue growth and even higher profitability growth in 2020, companies growing profitably at 45% a year tend to trade well above 50x earnings. At that price, BWMX is a $150 stock. To reiterate, all of these multiples are based on management’s forward guidance, which is extremely conservative.

We expect BWMX shares to increase from $45 to $100$120 in the next 6 to 18 months. If the market rewards BWMX in the same way it has other platform/marketplace companies, we can expect an upside target of over $200.

Q1 report was last night....blowout numbers again....stock has barely yawned.

**Q1 2021 Financial Highlights ($USD):**

* $144 million revenue (+205% YoY)
* $46 million EBITDA (+287% YoY)
* 31.8% EBITDA margin (vs. 25% Q1 2020)
* $32 million net income (+339% YoY - excluding currency hedging YoY, +578% growth)

**FY2021 Guidance (+10% from last update)**

* $552 million revenue (+60% YoY)
* $164 million EBITDA (+57% YoY)
* $124 million net income (+62% YoY)
* $106 million free cash flow (+77% YoY)
* $70 million USD dividend, remains same (3.9% yield)
* 14x P/E
* 10x EV/EBITDA

\- Guatemala expansion revenue up 382% YoY with 25% EBITDA

\- On track to expand into Peru and Colombia over next 2 years

Majority of 2021 CAPEX is related to the new headquarters/distribution center and other technology growth investments tied to that. Normalized free cash flow would be at least $10 million higher than shown here.

**Intro:** iRobot = Roomba, got it? It's really that simple. It's a household name brand that sells their robot vacuums, as well as automatic floor mopping robots, a robot that teaches kids to code(this speaks directly to my heart), and their new robotic lawn mower. Incorporated in 1990, Headquartered in Massachusetts, blah, blah, blah. 

**Bear case:** Yeah, we're going to do this analysis a little differently. 

There have been a few good threads examining IRBT, most of which have the same few comments and criticisms. 

1. ""There are so many low cost alternatives to the Roomba, iRobot has no chance at maintaining market leadership."" This isn't wrong, only... it kind of is. iRobot has been stating this for literally *years* in their 10Ks. They know it exists. There *are* low cost alternatives that reduce the quality vs price trade-off, but this does 2 things:
 * Creates a race to the bottom effect between low cost manufacturers thus competition grows between *them* just to survive. This reduces overall profitability of low cost brands and removes them from the market sooner.
 * Hurts the robovac industry *short term* as people purchase these low quality products, realize they're not super effective, and decide to just stick with a regular vacuum in the future. 

2. ""IRBT has failed to capitalize on their technology or to expand."" First of all, they lead the market in their technology and I don't mean ahead of the aforementioned discount brands, I mean against Samsung, Shark, and other major players in the household cleaning industry that have been established *for years.* They are specialists, through and through. Their process is slow and deliberate and that's *exactly* why they'll maintain their market edge. Admittedly, this is exactly what frustrates investors- the lack of perceived growth in a time when every other tech-centric consumer good is gaining momentum- and I love iRobot for this.

3.    ""IRBT stock price hasn't really moved much."" If you're investing based on stock price movement, you're not investing at all. But since I know that's not helpful, fine, the price has about tripled in the last 5 years.

Alright, I admit that the above Bear case was only used to illustrate some rebuttals to common arguments against IRBT. It's important to consider that just because I disagree with the arguments above, doesn't mean that the rest of the market does as well. Public sentiment is always a factor when considering investments and I realize that right now I'm betting against the above arguments. Below, I will get further into some of my subjective analysis that further defends this thesis.

**Metrics:**

1. **P/E** of 16. I know, everyone is hating on the P/E ratio lately, but it's still a valuable indicator of a company's performance whether we like it or not. Ok, so a P/E of 16 is reasonable at least, especially considering today's current max market P/E or Sharpe ratio. But that's not even why I'm mentioning it. If we exclude last year's COVID crisis effect on the market, iRobot's P/E ratio has *never* ***ever*** been this low. Now that's not to say it can't go lower, but I don't think I've ever seen a strong, high functioning company been as undervalued compared to itself as iRobot is right now. (MacroTrends)
2. **PEG ratio**, as a result of the above, is an absurd .89 if dividing P/E by the projected next 5 years of earnings growth. What's great about this is that that's *a low end estimate* for earnings growth. IRBT saw an earnings growth of 73% over the TTM, is projected for a 62% EPS growth over the coming year, and even their past 5 years show a 28.5% EPS growth. Dividing the P/E by any of those numbers makes the undervaluation theory *even stronger*. It's absurd how undervalued this is right now. (Finviz)
3. **Debt:** Zero debt, but I did want to mention this for a specific reason. When a company lacks *any* debt, it's perceived that growth is limited if financial leverage isn't being used. This is understandable, but I think that iRobot has found a middle ground between funding new projects with their own cash and maintaining a ridiculously healthy balance sheet.
4. **Other Basics:** Revenue, gross revenue, and Cash Flow from Operations has continued to climb steadily year after year. Their product lineup might not be growing, but they sure as Heck are growing stronger financially over time. Also, their entire cash position outweighs their entire Liabilities column on the Balance Sheet- how can you not love that?

5. **Institutional Ownership** is 100%. There's no real room here. This shows confidence in the company, but prevents major moves upward by a new, big interested buyer to jump the price significantly. It also brings along the potential risk of a major move down if an Institution decides it wants to pull out. What compounds this issue is that there's only about 28 million shares of iRobot to go around and while they have issued buybacks to reduce this amount, which is good for investors, it can also be very scary during tumultuous times. 

**Subjective analysis:** I love but had the concern going into this that the company hasn't ""grown"" in a few years. After looking through their financial statements, I've been proven wrong. As a matter of fact, they've proven me wrong time and time again when trying to find cracks in the armor. I was hoping that perception of their product lineup was poor- it's not. Even with Samsung being in the same market as them since 2014, Roomba has *crushed* their competition and it's partly because the customer base believes in them. I then turned my attention to employee sentiment -that too was a dead end. Glassdoor shows raves reviews for iRobot. People like working there.

Warren Buffett has said(yes, I know, the entirety of reddit quotes him but today this is extra applicable to this thesis) that there might be a thousand people who don't agree with your investing opinion- and that's fine. As it stands now, I don't think many people perceive iRobot as a company with the growth momentum of a rocket ship. Putting myself in the perspective of a business owner, which is what you become the moment you hit the 'Place Buy Order' button, has made me realize that I would love to own this business. It's a profitable leader in a market segment that has the *ability* to expand further into the quickly growing tech and robotics industries, but doesn't *rely* on them. So if the haters hate then let them hate, and watch the money pile up.

**Methodology**:

* Created a three-statement model for Verizon Communications., AT&amp;T., and T-mobile US
* Combined this model with a WACC build-up to create an unlevered DCF and derived a fair-value-per-share estimate using a growth in perpetuity and an exit EBITDA multiple approach
* Spread comparable companies (these 3 + CHTR, T.TO, and BCE.TO) 
* Combined results from DCF and select comps valuations to arrive at final estimates

&amp;#x200B;

**How to use the model**

* Anywhere you see blue text is OK to edit, and should not result in breaking anything. Green text = taken from another worksheet, so if you want to change one of those cells I recommend following the trail first
* To make meaningful changes to the 3-statement-model, scroll to the bottom of each ""Financials"" page to tweak assumptions about revenue growth, GPM, and other assumptions. You can also adjust the specifics for each case scenario from here
* I have tried to supply pessimistic assumptions about terminal growth rates and exit EBITDA multiples in the DCF models. Feel free to adjust C43 and H43 as needed, keeping in mind the model is very sensitive to these inputs
* WACC buildup can be done however you want. If you have access to a Bloomberg terminal you can  get a better adjusted beta than I used, and a more precise cost of debt (more on that below), or you can just use the override cell to put in a WACC% directly
* Trading Comps Input essentially works to arrive at normalized multiples before converting to an output. Do not be intimidated by non-Gaap disclosures. Everything here is available on annual reports, quarterly reports, and press releases.
* For trading comps outputs, simply toggle the companies in column B until you have the company you wish to analyze in the first position, and the other comps below it, then head to Valuation Matrix to see the results.
* Feel free to adjust the assumptions, there are a lot of them
* If you can think of an assumption better than something I have here, or if you spot a mistake let me know! 

&amp;#x200B;

**Other Notes:**

* I Imported the model from excel to Google Sheets before sharing --&gt; if something is broken, let me know so I can go in and fix it
* Of particular note in the comps spread is Charter Communications options outstanding. They provide a dollar figure, so I worked backwards to arrive at the correct value for Gross proceeds from exercise of options 
* Rogers Communications would have been included in the comps analysis, but I felt the pending merger would skew multiples beyond what could realistically be compared with the US big 3. I should probably include Vodafone but I was so excited to share! Maybe if you check back in I'll have added it :)
* Used 10Y YTM bond data on FINRA to arrive at assumptions for cost-of-debt used in WACC build-up. If you have access to a bloomberg terminal you can grab the bond with the best volume and use that. 
* I have my own opinions about the intangibles of these companies (management, forward looking results of the recent spectrum auction etc.) but I feel that if people want to chat about those things the comment section would be a better place to do it! 
* I apologize for ambiguity (especially on the non-gaap stuff) but I couldn't figure out how to remove my name from the comments quickly (if you know how to do this, other than going one-by-one through each comment, let me know and I'll reupload). Most comments were simply memos to myself to remember what each cell consists of beyond the label (i.e., components of ""other current assets"")
* A thousand more things. If you want to know just ask.

604,,ValueInvesting,"Recently I've been looking into home construction stocks such as $DHI. They seem to have decently high profit margins and ROI, low PE and P/FCF ratios.

From what I know, this has been a result of both inflationary pressures and a lack of workers being hired. What am I missing here? I want to believe this is a good opportunity to be in for the next year or so but does it look too straight-forward?

Edit:After further consideration I've taken up a small position in $STC over home construction stocks because I like its profit margins and its slightly higher resistance to inflation. Personally, I think lumber prices are caused by a combination of the huge unemployment benefits (which last til Sept), a few other seasonal hiring patterns, covid fears causing lower sellers in the market and a certain amount of inflation.

605,,ValueInvesting,"Just finished reading the recently published ""Richer, Wiser, Happier: How the World's Greatest Investors Win in Markets and Life"" by author William Green. OH MY GOD there is so much stuff in this book! There are interviews with Charlie Munger, Mohnish Pabrai, Joel Greenblatt, and about 40 other famous investors. Where to begin?

The Good: So. Much. Content. After finishing the book, I feel like I need to read it again. First, I want to make a list of each chapter's takeaways, and reflect on which ones will help me become a better investor. I would like to see which takeaways can be put into some kind of investing checklist. Second, at the end of the book there is a ""Notes on Sources and Additional Resources"", a treasure trove of books that I should read next.

The Bad: Hmmmm. I would say this book lacks focus. I mean, it's just all over the place. The chapters run long, and since each chapter is focused on a similar theme, it interweaves interviews from multiple investors. The result is a confusing whipsaw (wait, who was Bill Nygren again?) And sometimes the **important stuff** is bolded so that you don't miss it. **Except the important stuff is a really long sentence that you kind of have to read closely a few times to make sure you extract the point that the author was trying to convey**.

I enjoyed ""The Education of a Value Investor"", which Green assisted Guy Spier in writing, and this book sort of has a similar feel.

612,,ValueInvesting,"Hi guys! 

&amp;#x200B;

I've read the first chapter of Graham's book on The intelligent investor and I like to write summaries of it together with little interpretations. I usually post them on my blog or make videos out of such things. 

&amp;#x200B;

Either way, could you tell me if I am right or wrong in this summary/reflection? 

&amp;#x200B;

  

According to Graham, there is no such thing as a full-safe investment. Every stock has some speculative factor to it. This means that there usually are discrepancies between a value of a stock and its price because of the market. However, through; a) thorough analysis of a company; b) deliberate protection against serious losses of money; c) we aren’t aiming to win too much; then our investments will become safer. These three factors distinguish investment from speculation, and the number one thing to take from this is to know when you are investing and when you are speculating. 

Here are some important definitions to know, along with the three points above, so that you can see the difference between the two activities (taken from *Security Analysis*, 1934 ed., pp. 55-56): 

\- Thorough analysis = “the study of the facts in the light of established standards of safety and value”

\- Safety of principal = “protection against loss under all normal or reasonably likely conditions or variations” 

\- Adequate returns = “any rate or amount of return, however low, which the investor is willing to accept, provide he acts with reasonable intelligence” 

As a safety of principal, Graham advises us to put a separate fund for the speculative stocks and to not put any more money than what we initially put, especially if it is rising. This, in order for us to be financially and psychologically ok, even if it goes down. He further highlights to “\[n\]ever mingle your speculative and investment operations in the same account, nor in any part of your thinking” (*The intelligent investor*).

Thorough analysis is something which the speculative gambler does not do when putting money on stock, according to Graham. While a proper investor would look at the company’s earnings, operations, and other factors in order to determine if their value is under or above their set-priced-stock. 

What expecting an adequate return means to the investor is basically a question of how well the company is doing and what that can translate to in stock price rising and in dividends. A speculator, on the other hand, could be expecting far more just because some analysist said so, or because that particular stock is the next hype, and it’s already gone up by 1000% over one year. 

Sadly, just as in the 90s as today, many people decide that they will be speculative with their money and jump from one stock to the next through non-working investment techniques. They seemed to work in the past, since someone saw a pattern and thought that the statistics would repeat that patter. And what do you know it? It doesn’t! Every single investment technique that was basing its premiss on statistical patterns got outperformed by the S&amp;P500 in the 90s. Crazy right? 

The lessons for an investor therefore are: 

\- Never trick yourself into speculating while you think you are investing. 

\- Once you take your speculations seriously, this could have a mortal effect on you. 

\- Put a limit on how much you wish to wager on those speculative stocks so that you do not lose too much when and if that happens.",t2_c09pn3wh,False,,0,False,Did I understand Graham's definition of an investor and a speculator correctly?,[],r/ValueInvesting,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_n7qk9z,False,dark,0.91,,public,9,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Discussion,False,9,,False,False,spoiler,False,,[],{},,True,,1620513461.0,text,6,,,text,self.ValueInvesting,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi guys! &lt;/p&gt;

U.S Bancorp (USB) beauty is its under appreciation. It isn’t one of the big scary Wall Street Banks that sell junk to its clients and sometimes becomes a bit reckless loaning some family office more than 100% leverage.

Banks by and large have remained stabled throughout the pandemic. Recent yield curve steepening has made banks once again attractive.

U.S Bancorp noted in its recent Q1 filing that it expects that it expects it has hit rock bottom on the net interest margin side. Posting a low of 2.5%.

Net income results for the company indicate that the company and the economy are close to a post pandemic stage. With a 94.7% turnaround from Q1 last year resulting in almost $2.3 billion.

Though the stock sits at almost record highs there is still tremendous value. Currently they pay a reasonable 2.76% dividend. When comparing to its counterparts it does seem to be trading at a premium around 16 P/E.

However, it’s worth noting that part of the reason lies in how they were affected more adversely than the larger banks. Which they were able to make up lost revenue, via their trading desks during the heightened volatility period.

Currently USB trades at a 1.71 book value, whereas JPM trades at 1.74. Further research via DCF analysis shows the true value of USB. The assumption made for this DCF was a modest growth rate of 5% for five years, then a 4%, 3% and then 2% for the last three years. The value computed from this model gives a market cap of around $450 billion. Considerably higher than the $90b valuation right now.

Forward earnings yield sits at about 7.7% compared to that of the 8% JPM. However, through analysis it does look as though USB estimates are being lowballed.

However, there are a few risks that remain in the stock. The first one being big and dumb acquisitions. Banks recently have been making steps to take the fight fintech. The pursuit of acquisitions of fintech to build better moats can and has come at two big of a cost. As tech stocks trade at ridiculous valuations, the threat is ever greater.

The second risk comes in the form of loans and credit card side of the business. The effects of the pandemic still exist. That is reflected in the financials with delinquency rates still relatively high but will hopefully come down as unemployment reaches more normal levels.

Hello value investors!

As requested, I have done a deep dive analysis into Airtel Africa, discussing both the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the business. This is a company that has been on my watchlist for some time, but I’ve only now got round to analysing the business in depth. 

The link to the video is above, but in summary: 

Overview:
AAF is a UK listed telecommunications company operating in 14 countries in Africa. As of September 2020, it had 116 million subscribers to its services and is growing fast. 

Risks:
Poor balance sheet - As at the most recent quarter, AAF had a current ratio of 0.6, meaning they don’t have enough current assets to cover their current liabilities, thus increasing the likelihood of raising additional capital. 

Currency risk - AAF earn their revenues and receive their cash in various African currencies, meaning depreciation in these currencies against the US dollar (their reporting currency) will negatively impact results. 

COVID-19 impact - Many African countries don’t have significant access to vaccines, meaning COVID can continue to cause problems in the short to mid term future. 

Opportunities: 
Huge total accessible market - AAF currently only operate in 14 out of 54 African countries. The logical path for growth is expansion into more countries. 

Fast growing market - Sub-Saharan Africa have the fastest growing mobile phone market in the world, forecast to grow at a CAGR of 4.6%.

Intrinsic value calculation: 
To determine intrinsic value, I’ve used a discounted cash flow model and 10 year earnings multiple approach. Considering how conservative I’ve been with my growth numbers, the outcome is compelling. 

As always, I appreciate any time taken to read the post and watch the video. The purpose of this is to create discourse and provide a fair, balanced view from a variety of perspectives.",t2_bvaml57e,False,,0,False,Airtel Africa (AAF) analysis and intrinsic value calculation,[],r/ValueInvesting,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_n7lfsr,False,dark,0.91,,public,18,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Stock Analysis,False,18,,False,False,self,1620470897.0,,[],{},,True,,1620494470.0,text,6,,,text,self.ValueInvesting,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/9fccqZosb1k""&gt;https://youtu.be/9fccqZosb1k&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In summary, it's a mid cap company that packages and tests semiconductors. Semiconductor companies often outsource the complex manufacturing and testing processes of semiconductors to Amkor. With the this type of company there are high capex cost.

EV/ebitbda = 5

Considering it's in the semiconductor industry, I don't see 20-40% annual revenue growth too far out there.

Try your best at not being stupid.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;sup&gt;Be honest with yourself. If you have a &amp;#39;don&amp;#39;t know don&amp;#39;t care&amp;#39; attitude, don&amp;#39;t buy into a Magic Formula portfolio or any stock for that matter. You&amp;#39;ll be better off financially and mentally by dollar cost averaging into a market portfolio. Trust me you&amp;#39;ll sleep better. If you are interested, please do your due diligence on the stocks that are in your circle of competence and don&amp;#39;t just take any stocks that a screener gives you for granted. Analyse them and don&amp;#39;t be naïve. If you&amp;#39;re still willing to gamble, make sure you only risk 10% or less of your total portfolio and never add any more money to the gambles (who said you couldn&amp;#39;t have fun?&lt;/sup&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

**--Next Moves: Healthcare Applications--**

&amp;#x200B;

The healthcare sector is characterized by massive bureaucracy and opportunities for growth. It is one of the rare sectors where real future growth is possible by innovation. Microsoft has established itself as a corporate and industry suite, but now it seems that they are taking their whole Eco-system and moving on the healthcare industry.

This is pure speculation, but it can be one of the boldest moves yet, as healthcare facilities, operations, education, training, quality control are large complex systems that can benefit from the tools and services that the company offers.

We have seen Microsoft positioning for a certain client type and taking over most of their business. As the opportunities for growth in the corporate sector decrease, Microsoft might just turn to one of the most complex industries with high barriers to entry and large upfront investment costs.

On 11 April 2021 they entered into an agreement to acquire Nuance Communications for $ 56 per share, or $19.7 Billion. Nuance is a cloud and artificial intelligence (“AI”) software provider with healthcare and enterprise AI experience, and the acquisition will build on our industry-specific cloud offerings. This is effectively their foot in the door to the healthcare industry.

&amp;#x200B;

**--Value--**

I think that the company is trading around its intrinsic value, with potential for growth in the future. There is inflation related market risk that can push down value, but with proper management and pricing flexibility they can at least sustain current value levels.

Microsoft solidified the cloud for the corporate &amp; business sector, and decreased the risk of their sales by adopting a continuous subscription model for most of their services.

Their business model seems to be growth trough innovation as they are positioning themselves precisely in segments where innovation is lacking and are integrating those segments within their high-barrier to entry, complex systems.

# Other Observations

The stock price of ExxonMobil moves relative to the price of crude oil. In an article posted today, May 6th, oil prices fell 1% on worries over the pandemic surge in India. Projections over India's COVID cases are expected to peak around May 15th which can have an impact on oil prices and lead to a drop in ExxonMobil's stock price. If the drop in oil prices is drastic enough from India's surging cases, this creates a great entry point for individuals to get in on ExxonMobil.

# Final Thoughts

ExxonMobil is a company that is repositioning for a lower-carbon energy future by investing more into new technology and initiatives that will align with the growing economy while addressing global concerns. They are a good investment opportunity that has shown a steady rebound since the market fall in March 2020 due to COVID-19 and will continue to be a great growth stock with a lot of upside potential.

Recently I’ve been learning a lot more about value investing and intrinsic valuation. It’s made me realize that I had no true basis to buy and I don’t (yet) have the skill set needed to buy individual stocks. 

Many of the stocks I bought in the pandemic have recovered nicely.  I’ve been thinking more and more about selling them as soon as I hit long-term gains and then reinvesting them in index funds. Probably dollar-cost average over several months. I might keep a few as speculation and will plan to keep a good amount of cash around for dips and for when/if I feel confident enough to buy a stock.

Thoughts?

649,,ValueInvesting,"I was naive. At first, I thought what is the problem with a low yield (or high PE) environment? I guess I thought the worry is multiple contraction -- (PE is too high and corrects. Say halves). Then your investment halves.

&amp;#x200B;

However, the problem isn't just multiple contraction, it's also the low yields themselves. You are compounding at a lower rate. Of course this is obvious, but it does seem weird that the two scenarios aren't equivalent.

Even if you assume no earnings growth, the following scenarios are not equivalent for wealth creation.

Scenario 1: Stocks are at a 20PE and stay this way for 10 years.

Scenario 2: Stocks are at a 20 PE, contract to 10 PE by year 1. Stay at 10 PE and then expand back to 20 PE by year 10.

&amp;#x200B;

It is simpler if I do dividends. Assume no dividend growth.

Scenario 1: Stocks have Price/Dividend of 20 and stay this way for 10 years.

Value of $1 invested = (1.05)\^10

Scenario 2: Stocks have Price/Dividend of 20 initially. In 1 year they contract to Price/Dividend of 10 and at end they expand to Price/Dividend of 20.

Value of $1 invested at year 1 = 0.5 + 1\*0.05 (half stock value due to contraction + dividend)

year 2 = (0.5+ 0.05)\*1.1 (entire wealth is in stocks still)

year 3 = (0.5 + 0.05)\*1.1\^2

...

year 9 = (0.5+0.05)\*1.1\^8

year 10 = (0.5+0.05)\*1.1\^9 \* 2 (value of stocks doubled)

&amp;#x200B;

So either I am making a fallacious argument or the obvious is true. But I guess it surprises me that going from say 20 PE to 10 PE and then back to 20PE means more wealth creation for investors than merely maintaining 20PE.

So I guess the implications of the double whammy of high multiples are this: not only are the yields on stocks bad going forward, but a likely multiple contraction means one must (even more so) be invested longterm (as to not be penalized by the multiple contraction).

And the thing is you would want the multiple contraction to occur because at least then you can compound faster.

&amp;#x200B;

So here is the double whammy with these sky high valuations (I know... arguably not sky high because of low interest rates...)

I would want to be fully invest now, because I don't want to time the market-- afterall maybe a correction won't happen as treasury yields will just stay low forever, right? I am not timing the market because I shouldn't wait for a crash. However, secretly I want the crash even though I am fully invested.

So if I'm not market timing and being fully invested, it's as if I chose this route because I don't know if a crash is imminent, but at the same time I should hope a crash is imminent (despite being fully invested). This is even the case if I don't have any more wealth to add to the portfolio through a job!! This is quite paradoxical to me.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So, am I making a fallacious argument? The answer seems obviously intuitive when you think about it, but somehow it feels that something is wrong.

At the end of the day, I guess it shows you the power of value investing... I'm avoiding SPY and now I feel as though maybe I should take out a little bit from the portfolio in general.

&amp;#x200B;",t2_rd5k48v,False,,0,False,Is this a fallacy or a double whammy of low yield environment?,[],r/ValueInvesting,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_n628cb,False,dark,0.76,,public,2,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Question / Help,False,2,,False,False,self,1620289082.0,,[],{},,True,,1620317067.0,text,6,,,text,self.ValueInvesting,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was naive. At first, I thought what is the problem with a low yield (or high PE) environment? I guess I thought the worry is multiple contraction -- (PE is too high and corrects. Say halves). Then your investment halves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the problem isn&amp;#39;t just multiple contraction, it&amp;#39;s also the low yields themselves. You are compounding at a lower rate. Of course this is obvious, but it does seem weird that the two scenarios aren&amp;#39;t equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you assume no earnings growth, the following scenarios are not equivalent for wealth creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scenario 1: Stocks are at a 20PE and stay this way for 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scenario 2: Stocks are at a 20 PE, contract to 10 PE by year 1. Stay at 10 PE and then expand back to 20 PE by year 10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is simpler if I do dividends. Assume no dividend growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scenario 1: Stocks have Price/Dividend of 20 and stay this way for 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Value of $1 invested = (1.05)^10&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scenario 2: Stocks have Price/Dividend of 20 initially. In 1 year they contract to Price/Dividend of 10 and at end they expand to Price/Dividend of 20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Value of $1 invested at year 1 = 0.5 + 1*0.05 (half stock value due to contraction + dividend)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;year 2 = (0.5+ 0.05)*1.1 (entire wealth is in stocks still)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;year 3 = (0.5 + 0.05)*1.1^2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;year 9 = (0.5+0.05)*1.1^8&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;year 10 = (0.5+0.05)*1.1^9 * 2 (value of stocks doubled)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So either I am making a fallacious argument or the obvious is true. But I guess it surprises me that going from say 20 PE to 10 PE and then back to 20PE means more wealth creation for investors than merely maintaining 20PE.&lt;/p&gt;

As of May 5 2021, at 11:52 AM a google search has BIG trading for $67.75 / share, at a total market capitalization of \~$2.4B.  [Most Recent 10-K](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/768835/000076883521000028/big-20210130.htm) was released 3/30/21 FYE 1/30/21. Looking to the income statements Big Lots sales have been increasing YOY, along with net income and EPS. This is also true, prior to Covid.

Recall the valuation of $2.4B. Big lots financials show $560M in cash on the balance sheet, in conjunction with a 1.6x current ratio, increasing operating cash flows, conservative leverage of 2.15x Debt to Equity (primarily their $1.5B in operating leases). The balance sheet presents $1.2B in book equity; $560M of which we know is cash.  Prior to COVID, EPS had increased by 61% from $3.83 to $6.18 (net incomes of $157M to \~$242M, respectively). During COVID this exploded of course to $16.46 per share, along with the share price to some extent.

Now, what if we pro-forma'ed these financials showing only an increase similar to the prior year, instead of the absurd increase we actually saw? That would be something like $9.89/share (60% increase, as opposed to the more dramatic COVID-driven increase).

The current share price of $67.82 presents a Price to Earnings ratio of \~6.86x. Now, despite the recent run-up in the share price, I would argue this one was underpriced to begin with. Big Lots competitive position, earnings power, and growth prospects are still stronger than the market understands at this time. I would sell this stock at 15-20x earnings, but for now I think it's a buy.

I think Big Lots is under-loved because the convention has been that companies like Amazon are and will continue to ""crush"" companies like Big Lots. But, I haven't seen that to be the case since Big Lots [revamped it's strategy.](https://alloy.institute/big-lots-case-study)

661,,ValueInvesting,"*“Ben Graham, my friend and teacher, long ago described the mental attitude toward market fluctuations that I believe to be most conducive to investment success. He said that you should imagine market quotations as coming from a remarkably accommodating fellow named Mr. Market who is your partner in a private business.*

*Without fail, Mr. Market appears daily and names a price at which he will either buy your interest or sell you his.*

*Even though the business that the two of you own may have economic characteristics that are stable, Mr. Market’s quotations will be anything but. For, sad to say, the poor fellow has incurable emotional problems. At times he feels euphoric and can see only the favorable factors affecting the business.*

*When in that mood, he names a very high buy-sell price because he fears that you will snap up his interest and rob him of imminent gains. At other times he is depressed and can see nothing but trouble ahead for both the business and the world. On these occasions he will name a very low price, since he is terrified that you will unload your interest on him.*

*Mr. Market has another endearing characteristic: He doesn’t mind being ignored. If his quotation is uninteresting to you today, he will be back with a new one tomorrow. Transactions are strictly at your option. Under these conditions, the more manic-depressive his behavior, the better for you.*

*But, like Cinderella at the ball, you must heed one warning or everything will turn into pumpkins and mice:* ***Mr. Market is there to serve you, not to guide you****. It is his pocketbook, not his wisdom, that you will find useful. If he shows up some day in a particularly foolish mood, you are free to ignore him or to take advantage of him, but it will be disastrous if you fall under his influence.*

He said that you should imagine market quotations as coming from a remarkably accommodating fellow named Mr. Market who is your partner in a private business.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Without fail, Mr. Market appears daily and names a price at which he will either buy your interest or sell you his.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even though the business that the two of you own may have economic characteristics that are stable, Mr. Market’s quotations will be anything but. For, sad to say, the poor fellow has incurable emotional problems. At times he feels euphoric and can see only the favorable factors affecting the business.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When in that mood, he names a very high buy-sell price because he fears that you will snap up his interest and rob him of imminent gains. At other times he is depressed and can see nothing but trouble ahead for both the business and the world. On these occasions he will name a very low price, since he is terrified that you will unload your interest on him.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mr. Market has another endearing characteristic: He doesn’t mind being ignored. If his quotation is uninteresting to you today, he will be back with a new one tomorrow. Transactions are strictly at your option. Under these conditions, the more manic-depressive his behavior, the better for you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But, like Cinderella at the ball, you must heed one warning or everything will turn into pumpkins and mice:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mr. Market is there to serve you, not to guide you&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;. It is his pocketbook, not his wisdom, that you will find useful. If he shows up some day in a particularly foolish mood, you are free to ignore him or to take advantage of him, but it will be disastrous if you fall under his influence.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Indeed, if you aren’t certain that you understand and can value your business far better than Mr. Market, you don’t belong in the game. As they say in poker, “If you’ve been in the game 30 minutes and you don’t know who the patsy is, you’re the patsy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

AutoNation sells cars. Lots of them. Their bread and butter is new cars, but they're investing heavily in expanding their used car business (going from 5 used car stores this year to 130 by 2026). 

According to Yahoo Finance, AutoNation ""offers a range of automotive products and services, including new and used vehicles; and parts and services, such as automotive repair and maintenance, and wholesale parts and collision services. The company also provides automotive finance and insurance products comprising vehicle services and other protection products, as well as arranges finance for vehicle purchases through third-party finance sources.""

### What I like about AutoNation:

* AutoNation is a company primed to capitalize on post-COVID economic trends. Used car prices have soared in the past year. To take advantage of this, the company is expanding AutoNation USA, their used car business. They see this as a profitable opportunity for growth – they currently have five stores, but are aiming to grow to 130 AutoNation USA stores by 2026.
* AutoNation CEO Mike Jackson had this to say on their recent earnings call, “Demand continues to exceed supply for new vehicles, and we expect this to continue through 2021. More importantly, low interest rates and consumer preference for vehicle ownership versus ride-sharing and public transportation are supporting demand.”
* Interest rates. It’s cheap AF to finance a car right now, which means more people are buying them.
* AutoNation’s been buying back stock the last few quarters, which means that although they don’t pay dividends, they’re still giving value back to shareholders.
* People are about to start driving a lot more now that vaccines are rolling out and people are returning to the office. More cars on the road means more business for AutoNation.
* They just posted an all-time high earnings per share of $2.79, which beat estimates by $0.92.
* Q1 revenue and same-store gross profit increased 27% YOY.
* They recently acquired 11 dealerships from Peacock Automotive Group, which represents $380 million in annual revenue.

### My concerns about AutoNation:

My main concern is that AutoNation could be a COVID darling that can’t maintain the incredible results it’s posted the 12 months. If demand for cars wanes, or if we experience an economic downturn, the company’s stock price could suffer. In the case of a recession, car purchases would be greatly affected.

### The Wrap Up

I typically hold a company for 1-2 years, so I feel comfortable with the short-term risks associated with AutoNation. I expect the economy to continue to climb over the next year, and car demand to remain strong. With it’s high-growth, improving margins, strong balance sheet, and attractive value, I think AutoNation is uniquely positioned to capitalize on those trends.

The stock price has had a massive run-up the past 12 months (200%). Even so, I think it still offers around 20% potential upside. I view it as a relatively safe bet due to the demand for cars right now and the company’s strong recent results.

663,,ValueInvesting,"Hi here I want to tell you about what I think is the most undervalued stock right now. It can be a huge value play here’s why:

GROWTH : 37% yoy in revenues, cloud business with now positive Ebita and growing at 50%.

The company operates in the online-retail market (mainly) in China, which is expected to grow its GDP and surpass the USA in 2028.

Debt and Moat: Low debt, can pay all its debt with cash, so it can be considered a financial fortress as Buffett uses to say.

Alibaba has definitely a moat with can be seen from different points of view:

1) Network effect = The fact that the 53% of online- retail sales is from Alibaba and its platform creates a continuous increase in the number of users.

2)Barriers to entry= In this market there are only few players becoming a sort of oligopoly.

3)Economies of scale= Alibaba has shown its ability to scale, and so to increase its revenues without decreasing its profit margins, and it is able to grow and at the same time to reduce the “per-product-cost”.

4) Substitution costs= Alibaba operates with online- salers which probably have made investments in order to position themselves in the Alibaba platforms, and it could be a huge cost to change platform.

PRICE: Alibaba trades at 25/26 PE, forward PE of  20. And here nothing else to say. Considered the future growth is very cheap.

WHY IT IS UNDERVALUED: It is undervalued because market hates uncertainty and I think that the market fears are 

A) Usa-China relationships

B)CCP, because it is mainly a dictatorship and for example the ccp can do whatever he whats with its companies and population

—&gt; WHY THE MARKET IS MAKING A HUGE MISTAKE: 

CCP is in continuous competition with USA, and I think that it will never destroy his “diamond tips - companies like BABA or Tencent.

CCP ,as Charlie Munger said at BRK annual meeting in Los Angeles, has discovered the “formula” that is a form of economic-regulated capitalism.

For these reasons I think baba is hugely undervalued and as its fair price could be 320/330$ per ADR share.

Any good investor heavily considers the underlying performance of a business before buying into them, so why shouldn't we do the same on reddit?

If you have not heard the song *Lawyers, Guns, and Money* by Warren Zevon then you're not missing much, but it does loosely tie into my analysis of **Academy Sports + Outdoors**.

**Intro:** There's a chance you haven't heard of Academy Sports if you're not from the Southern United States- and that's ok. The business is simple, Academy Sports operates as a sporting goods and outdoor recreational products retailer, similarly to Dick's Sporting Goods, Bass Pro Shops, Cabela's, and Sportsman's Warehouse. In terms of business model, there's not much more to it than that, except for 1 key difference compared to Dick's and some other competitors; **Academy Sports sells guns and ammunition**. I'll be using some comparisons to these company's in the analysis below. 

**Notes:**

1. The reason I'm putting this write-up together today is because of recent action on behalf of the major shareholders. I will go more into detail on that below.
2. ASO was intially publicly offered at the beginning of October 2020. I typically stay away from IPOs in general, but took a look at the company and decided to do a deeper dive. 

**Metrics:** 

1. **ROIC**, as of today, is 12.48%. This has improved year over year since 2019(the company was private before this so financial statements only go back so far) and doubled from 2020 to 2021. While Sportsman's Warehouse has had double digit ROIC over the last few years as well, it's more sporadic and up or down with some negative returns mixed in quarterly as well. Dick's is the steadier of the 2 comparisons maintaining that ~10% ROIC over the last few years(GuruFocus).
2. **D/E ratio** is currently at about .71. The good news, however, is that because ASO exists largely in the Southern United States, they did not bleed as much during the Lockdown Era. Depending upon the state, stores were kept open and selling while competitors had to close their doors and take on more leverage to survive. This is reflected further in ASO's financial statements showing that virtually all of their existing debt is long term. Their current cash position outweighs their short term debt substantially. (Side note, their cash position has been *at least doubling* every year for the last 3 years.)
3. **P/E &amp; PEG** ratios are 8.91 and .21, respectively. The PEG ratio is based on Finviz's EPS Next 5 years expectations, but since I'm a fan of extrapolating out a shorter amount of time from the most recent data as possible, a safer PEG ratio to assume is 8.91/11.05(Next year's EPS growth expectations), which would be .80 instead. Again, this is the *low end* EPS growth expectations for ASO. Admittedly, the previous year was a great boon for outdoor and sporting goods retailers, so instead, if you'd like to take a larger sample size of the last 5 years EPS growth it would be 8.91/32.7, or .27 PEG ratio. For a quick comparison, Dick's expected EPS for next year is an 8% growth and with a P/E of 15.77, that yields a PEG ratio of 1.9. But I didn't need to calculate that to tell you that Dick's is largely done expanding and growing. 
4. **Cash flow from Operations** has skyrocketed over the last few years, but it's important to note an anomaly. A large change in payables occurred from 2020 to 2021 which significantly impacted ASO's change in working capital. If removing it from the equation, to help get a better understanding of their cash flow operations, they still nearly *tripled* cash flow from continuing operations. Net income from continuing operations over the last few years has grown at an incredible rate too. (Yahoo Finance). Gross profit in general has followed a similar escalation path.
5. **The outside influence** of the guns &amp; ammunition industry, while not a strict mathematical metric, should also be considered. Academy Sports, described by one of my Texas-born friends, is ""an institution."" Currently there is an on-going ammo shortage that's affecting the industry that is expected to grow at a rate of at least 6% a year through the next 5 years(Mordor Intelligence). The sports gun market is growing and many competitors simply do not offer to fill that market niche. 

**So what's the catch?**
Well, I talked about the Guns... I talked about the Money... What about the Lawyers? Academy Sports is largely owned by private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts or KKR &amp; Co. Inc. for short. As of this morning, they own roughly 65% of Academy Sports, making them the majority decision makers for the company. I want to be clear, **this is both good and bad**. Such a large position of ownership controlling the decisions for ASO will almost always benefit KKR moreso than other shareholders. On the other hand, KKR invested in ASO in 2011 and have helped establish the company as a quickly growing and successful retailer. The two are intertwined in a way that is mutually beneficial to each other, but not as much for shareholders. **Fortunately, this will change over time**.

Academy Sports + Outdoors announced after market on May 3rd that KKR will be issuing an additional 14 million shares of stock. For context, that accounts for roughly 1/3 of the current share float so this will dilute the shares fairly significantly. The upside to this is two-fold: 

1.  Starting today, shares should start trading a discounted, enticing price.
2. ASO also agreed to buyback as much as $100 million shares worth of the offering, thus reducing the dilution and adding to shareholder wealth. 

**Subjective analysis:** I like ASO and I like its prospects. It has the growth potential that Dick's no longer has, their management team has helped been guided by KKR to profitability, and it fills a market niche that some other competitors do not fill. It's important to note that the unraveling of KKR's shares will continue to happen over time, which will simultaneously frustrate shareholders but also spread ownership to a more reasonable degree across the Institutional spectrum. Their new focus on ecommerce has helped strengthen their bottom line and it's already started to pay dividends *without* considerable store growth. In a recent report, management had stated that 2021 won't be a time of store openings due to the inability to properly scout locations(although it was stated that 2022 should see 8-10 new openings). This is the slow growth mentality that I'm all for. This will likely be a multi-year hold for me, but it could just be the next big thing in Outdoor Sports &amp; Recreation.

672,,ValueInvesting,"Summary

Ex Shell asset that they already spent £37 miillion in development , including the Chuditch-1 Discovery well

Their initial assessment of those leads near on 6 TCF of GIIP with much upside across the wider license (Standard conversion 1 TCF = 170 Million BOE)

Shell drilled CH-1 in only 26 days if I remember at a cost of $8 million So potential rapid FFD

Timor Leste appear to have now done a U turn on Sunrise and all now to be processed and the Woodford/other massive new refinery/LNG complex at Darwin, if you look at the map/link (few mins ago)

Darwin already has a gas pipeline all the way from Darwin to Bayu Undan Gas field, the short join the dots tie in of Sunrise to Bayu Undan would come right past us, giving us an even shorter tie in to that production pipeline

In recent weeks several licenses have sprung back into action after years of delays due to the politics, now all resolved, with multiple drills planned including by Santos and our own London Listed Adv Advance with another Aussie Carnarthon?

As part of the new license round TGS (Norway a world leader) commenced 2d cubed seismic over the entire area 50,000 square KM, the first data according to its website last year was to be end of July and all by October for viewing in a data room - bids for round to close late October

The Government in September announced the licences which where to be awarded in December and issued in January was now being delayed to give bidders more time

Our now 85% owned Sundagas has been a leading contributor and organiser of multiple local TL events and Oil and Gas conferences assisting the local NOC with CGG, so the expectation was we might also GET one of the new bid licenses

NOW 24th March we announce the current churn placing to take 85% of SundaGas equity WHY NOW, we attempted to RTO them 100% shortly after they stole the license on the cheap , nepotism lol, one of the 2 directors who invented and listed SG on the Singapore exchange , related to one of our own BOD :))))

We in a tough market at the time could not raise sufficient funds and just took 33% as said so why now the rush perhaps

25/26th March - 3rd Timor Leste Oil and Gas Conference (this time online) Again SG and CGG heavily involved and original announcement was 25th then became a two day event (hmm)

&lt;p&gt;Ex Shell asset that they already spent £37 miillion in development , including the Chuditch-1 Discovery well&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their initial assessment of those leads near on 6 TCF of GIIP with much upside across the wider license (Standard conversion 1 TCF = 170 Million BOE)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shell drilled CH-1 in only 26 days if I remember at a cost of $8 million So potential rapid FFD&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Timor Leste appear to have now done a U turn on Sunrise and all now to be processed and the Woodford/other massive new refinery/LNG complex at Darwin, if you look at the map/link (few mins ago)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Darwin already has a gas pipeline all the way from Darwin to Bayu Undan Gas field, the short join the dots tie in of Sunrise to Bayu Undan would come right past us, giving us an even shorter tie in to that production pipeline&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent weeks several licenses have sprung back into action after years of delays due to the politics, now all resolved, with multiple drills planned including by Santos and our own London Listed Adv Advance with another Aussie Carnarthon?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the new license round TGS (Norway a world leader) commenced 2d cubed seismic over the entire area 50,000 square KM, the first data according to its website last year was to be end of July and all by October for viewing in a data room - bids for round to close late October&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government in September announced the licences which where to be awarded in December and issued in January was now being delayed to give bidders more time&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our now 85% owned Sundagas has been a leading contributor and organiser of multiple local TL events and Oil and Gas conferences assisting the local NOC with CGG, so the expectation was we might also GET one of the new bid licenses&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NOW 24th March we announce the current churn placing to take 85% of SundaGas equity WHY NOW, we attempted to RTO them 100% shortly after they stole the license on the cheap , nepotism lol, one of the 2 directors who invented and listed SG on the Singapore exchange , related to one of our own BOD :))))&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We in a tough market at the time could not raise sufficient funds and just took 33% as said so why now the rush perhaps&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;25/26th March - 3rd Timor Leste Oil and Gas Conference (this time online) Again SG and CGG heavily involved and original announcement was 25th then became a two day event (hmm)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two agenda items of note A major presentation by Sundagas on the Chuditch discovery and the prospects within the full license area CGG had 2 big slots but most interesting the title on the 2nd slot A presentation on the super resolution Seismic and the prospects it has revealed !!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TGS are now currently reprocessing the 3d that includes our block and has been made available to SG&lt;/p&gt;

675,,ValueInvesting,"So I’m sure you’ve all seen rumblings about inflation. Money printer go Brrrr and next logical step is inflation of some sort, right?

An extreme example of inflation like the one in post WWI Germany led to crazy stuff like people burning wads of cash in their fireplaces because the paper currency was cheaper than firewood.

I don’t think that’s where we’re heading, but Charlie Munger did this interview in December 2020 and he said that we’re in uncharted waters and that many governments are playing with fire with the boatloads of currency they’ve been printing.

So I took a look through previous interviews with Warren Buffett to figure out how he dealt with inflation from an investing standpoint. As an investor, Warren Buffett has seen 2 more recent periods of high inflation. Inflation was 11% in 1974, and it was over 13% in 1980. By comparison, inflation is currently around 2-3%.

He said the best business to own is one where you can maintain the earnings in real dollars without having to reinvest into that business. So businesses that don't require big capital expenditures in ""inflationary dollars"".

**Bad business during inflation**

Warren gave the example of airlines being a poor business during inflationary times, especially if they need to replace their fleet of airplanes. Because the airlines have to reinvest into airplanes, and those planes will cost a lot in “inflationary dollars”.

That will eat away at the returns for investors. Essentially the airline would have a big cost that they have to pay in inflationary dollars. That would be really hard to pass on to the consumer.

So if you think there's high inflation in the pipeline, you’d want to avoid businesses that have big looming capital expenses coming up. Maybe this was part of his thesis for selling his positions in the airlines?

**Good business for inflation times**

See’s Candies is one example from Warren. He bought the See’s candy chain of stores in 1972 and inflation was 11% two years later. See’s didn’t have any big capital expenditures.

Their biggest expense was raw ingredients going into the candies, rent for the facilities and labour. They didn't have to buy big new machinery or replace a factory or anything like that. Also, the cost of a candy is relatively low when you look at a person's overall budget and See’s Candies are mostly given as gifts.

So even if the raw ingredients like sugar, cocoa and butter go up in price, See’s was able to pass on the extra cost to the consumer and sales volumes didn’t go down. Warren likes businesses that are recurring purchases that people will keep buying with ""inflationary dollars"".

You'll often hear people say that gold or commodities are good inflation hedges. But if you’ve followed Warren’s career you’ll notice that he hasn’t done a “pure commodity play”. He’s owned a silver company, gold company (which he sold recently), and has owned oil companies, but IMO those were more of a reflection of the valuation of companies as opposed to a thesis on commodity prices. Warren has notoriously spoken against investing in gold for example.

For a more detailed breakdown, I recorded a podcast that you can check out [here](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4bPJZclxIRYeRSOMhFTdsz) (you don't need a Spotify subscription to listen)

**TL;DR**

* Printer go Brrrr - Looks like there's inflation on the horizon
* Assuming inflation is coming, a bad business to own is one where you have large looming capex that will be spent in “inflationary dollars” (ex airline with old fleet of planes)

When I did a discounted cash flow based on an 8% discount rate and moderate growth for the next 5 years (and slower growth for the next 5) I came up with a fair value of $206/share.  They also have a nice semi-annual dividend and generate massive amounts of cash.

Hello Value Investors!

I've created a new YouTube channel (and hence created a new reddit account to associate with it) and have made a video showing my qualitative and quantitative analysis on British American Tobacco, the second largest Tobacco producer in the world by market capitalisation.

The stock is currently trading at levels similar to the lows of the Covid-19 crash and in the video I discuss whether I think it could be a value play, or a value trap, and also provide my intrinsic value calculation using a combination of the discounted cash flow model and future earnings multiples.

I'd appreciate it if you spared some time to take a look at the video and let me know what you think.

This is more a discussion/question about why my formula calculations are drastically different than WallStreenZen's calculated values of the said formula.*

I recently discovered the site [WallStreetZen](https://www.wallstreetzen.com/) (WSZ) site, which I have enjoyed using, but I am having difficulty reproducing their calculated values of the Benjamin Graham Formula (from chapter 11 of the “The Intelligent Investor”). For reference, the formula (page 295 of “The Intelligent Investor,” revised edition, 2006) is as follows:

Value = Current (Normal) Earnings \* (8.5 + 2*g*)

where *g* is the expected annual growth rate and “Current (Normal) Earnings” is usually meant to be EPS (ttm).

On WSZ’s [Benjamin Graham Stock Screener](https://www.wallstreetzen.com/stock-screener/ben-graham-stock-screener), they list a number of companies trading below the intrinsic value of the above formula (at least, as they calculate it). For example, Universal Logistics Holdings (NASDAQ: ULH) currently trades at $24.27, but has, according to WSZ, an intrinsic value of $488.94. This seems preposterous. Based on my application of the Graham Formula, the intrinsic value should be closer to $50.

ULH Intrinsic Value = $1.78 \* (8.5 + 2\*10%) = $50.73

where $1.78 is the EPS (ttm; Yahoo Finance) and *g* = 10% (which is lower than the consensus yearly growth estimate of 13.2%, according to Yahoo Finance)

Even if I use the [adjusted Graham’s Formula](https://www.oldschoolvalue.com/stock-valuation/benjamin-graham-formula/), the final valuation is $72, still well under WSZ’s $488 value.

Adjusted ULH Intrinsic Value = ($1.78 \* \[7 + 1\*10%\] \* 4.4) / 1.85 = $71.97

where the EPS (ttm) is $1.78, *g* = 10%, 4.4 is the minimum rate of return (a formula constant), and 1.85 is the US corporate AA effective yield (according to YCharts).

**Does anyone know how WSZ is getting such an inflated value for ULH?** Many of their other Graham Formula intrinsic value calculations are also extremely high (it’s not just ULH). If anyone knows the calculation/details behind their calculation, I would be really interested in hearing about it. I might reach out to WallStreetZen directly via the contact email on their website, too.

Thanks!

Hello investors,

It's been a while since I last posted a memo and I am still going through a busy transition with the work. I hope everyone is staying safe and riding the markets to the top.

**1) Fundamental vs Technical Analysis**

I wanted to discuss a topic that should probably have been addressed earlier. I didn't realize until recently that many of the folks that are just getting started in trading tend to lean more towards the ""technical"" analysis of investing and I believe it is critical to understand what the difference is between a technical and fundamental analysis.

**Quick answer to the question of which works better, there is no better or worse. It's a combination of the two that makes an analysis more comprehensive, based on a** **Mosaic Theory****.**

Just for the sake of formality, here are the quick definitions of each.

**Technical analysis:** Technical analysis is concerned with price action, which gives clues as to the stock’s supply and demand dynamics – which is what ultimately determines the stock price. Patterns often repeat themselves because investors often behave in the same way in the same situation. Technical analysis is concerned with price and volume data alone.

**Fundamental analysis**: Fundamental analysis considers the value of the company. This ultimately depends on the value of its assets and the profits it can generate. Fundamental analysts are concerned with the difference between a stock’s value, and the price at which it is trading.

Many people tend to look at the charts and patterns of stock price movements and make quick decisions based purely on the technicals, such as breaking out of a resistance level, forming a consolidation, gapping, ascending vs descending triangles, moving averages, and so on.

I think what many fail to understand is that these trading strategies are highly specialized, meaning that there are hundreds of thousands of people trying to benefit from this type of analysis and most of them fail to achieve consistent returns.

And these are industry veterans with years of experience and the resources with computing power to recognize patterns and being able to execute on the trade ideas in a millionth of a second.

It's not to say that you can't profit consistently from these strategies. I'm saying you cannot simply rely on ""this stock price just broke the 200-D moving average and has a potential to move exponentially higher"" type of analysis.

There is a concept called **""efficient market hypothesis"" (""EMH"")**, which basically states that share prices reflect all information and consistent alpha generation is impossible.

Now, I have previously mentioned that it is possible to generate alpha in this memo.

What I didn't mention is different levels of EMH.

**Weak efficiency: This type of EMH claims that all past prices of a stock are reflected in today's stock price. Therefore, technical analysis cannot be used to predict and beat the market.**

**Semi-strong efficiency: This form of EMH implies all public (but not non-public) information is calculated into a stock's current share price. Neither fundamental nor technical analysis can be used to achieve superior gains.**

**The point of today's memo is that I believe the market tends to fluctuate between weak and semi-strong efficiency levels of EMH, meaning a combination of fundamental and technical analysis can lead to excess returns and I personally tend to put a heavier weight into the fundamental analysis.**

From a personal standpoint, technical analysis is almost a 50/50 chance game for an average trader. A person who monitors charts at home during the day out of his/her 4 monitors will almost never generate consistent profits over 10-20 year period.

Don't get me wrong. It is possible to generate alpha for that person.

All I'm saying is of the 1,000 hours he spent monitoring and trading on those securities, only 10 hours of research actually resulted in any profitable ideas and he just racked up tens of thousands of dollars in trading fees, **just to increase his winning odds from 51% of all trades to 52%.**

It's not really an efficient way to use your time and energy if you ask me.

After all, technical trading yields very thin odds of success, anywhere from 51% to 53% winning probability on any single trade. That's why professional investors diversify their strategies across hundreds of different trades in a single hour using automated trades, which an average investor doesn't have the capacity to do so.

My suggestion is to approach it from the Warren Buffett style of investing.

Study the company, understand the business model, and evaluate how the company is priced relative to your view of the intrinsic value.

**One important caution to this approach.**

I have also observed recently that many people tend to buy into this type of analysis: **""COVID-19 is almost near the finish line and people will likely to eat out at bars and restaurants and therefore, I will buy the restaurant stocks.""**

Or this, **""Biden administration is pushing clean energy policy and EV stocks will outperform.""**

While these are good ideas to start off of, they're not the end.

It's almost like saying ""US population is increasing and more people will drive cars. Therefore, I will buy auto stocks.""

These are big leaps in assumptions. We need to fill in the gaps.

My suggestion is to think in more depth, especially in terms of numbers.

For example, ""COVID-19 is almost near the finish line and restaurant visits are increasing as % of 2019 levels. Darden Restaurants is poised to benefit from this trend because it is highly specialized in an indoor dining experience and the demand is picking up, as evidenced by its growing sales numbers that are higher than its competitors. The stock is currently trading at 37x 2021 P/E, which seems to be undervalued given the fact that it is expected to grow its bottom line at more than 40% over the next three years, yielding a PEG ratio of less than 1. Its peers are also trading at 50x 2021 P/E. Therefore, if the company exceeds the profit growth expectations, the stock has a potential to outperform the market.""

This is a more in-depth fundamental analysis, divided into two parts: 1) qualitative factors that prove why the company is better positioned against its competitors and 2) quantitative factors (mainly the valuation, or what the market priced in) that will drive its stock price outperformance.

**The bottom line is, when you are picking stocks, do not make the big leap in assumptions, coupled with preliminary technical analysis. Instead, approach it from a view of an investor: ""what is good about this business and why would I buy into this company rather than its competitor who seems to be having more success? Is the company priced at an appropriate valuation? Will its market cap grow from $10B to $50B? And why?""**

Which leads me to the second topic of today's memo.

**2) Why does the stock price drop after an earnings beat?**

The answer is simple: it's because the market has priced in a better outlook than what's reported.

If the street consensus estimate was $2 EPS for a company and the earnings came out to $3, it doesn't mean the stock price will jump. And it can be for many different reasons.

Perhaps the company beat on the earnings but fell below the estimates on the topline.

Or the company's margins shrank dramatically.

Or the company sold lower volumes of a new line of cars than expected, which was supposed to show an exponential growth. But the higher-priced cars offset the losses and still resulted in an earnings beat. The market was pricing in the growth of the new line of cars but now that growth expectation has disappeared.

You really need to think at a high level on earnings beat. It's not a 1+1=2 type of problem.

**On top of that, you will never know what the market has priced in its growth expectations until the actual earnings come out.**

This is because we can only know what the market has priced in only after observing the stock price reaction after the earnings. Because the stock price dropped after the earnings, the market was expecting a better outcome than the actual and by definition, it is an after-the-fact analysis.

Over time, the stock price mean reverts to its earnings potential and any anomalies in the way will be reverted back.

Thus, a better game to play is to focus on its fundamentals, study the earnings, and determine if this company will outperform not just qualitatively but also from a quantitative perspective. Will it expand its trading multiple? Will the earnings outperform the street expectations?

Hope this helps and thank you for reading!

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On top of that, you will never know what the market has priced in its growth expectations until the actual earnings come out.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is because we can only know what the market has priced in only after observing the stock price reaction after the earnings. Because the stock price dropped after the earnings, the market was expecting a better outcome than the actual and by definition, it is an after-the-fact analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time, the stock price mean reverts to its earnings potential and any anomalies in the way will be reverted back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, a better game to play is to focus on its fundamentals, study the earnings, and determine if this company will outperform not just qualitatively but also from a quantitative perspective. Will it expand its trading multiple? Will the earnings outperform the street expectations?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps and thank you for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers&lt;/p&gt;

Plus500 Ltd

**15.1** GBP

**101.42m** Shares Outstanding

**Business Description**

Plus500 Ltd. develops and operates an online and mobile trading platform for individual customers to trade contracts for difference (CFDs). The company's online trading and mobile platform allows its customers to trade CFDs on approximately 2,500 underlying financial instruments, including equities, indices, commodities, options, exchange-traded funds, cryptocurrencies, shares, and foreign exchange in approximately 50 countries in 32 languages. Its trading platform is accessible from various operating systems, such as Windows, iOS, Android, and Surface, as well as web browsers. The company was formerly known as Investsoft Ltd. and changed its name to Plus500 Ltd. in June 2012. Plus500 Ltd. was incorporated in 2008 and is headquartered in Haifa, Israel.

**Competitors**

Plus500 is very different compared to its competitors. The platform is user-friendly and provides unlimited access to a demo account, providing the time and flexibility to learn about CFD trading. It has a customer centric approach with available 24/7 either via live chat, email or What’s App.

However, if we compare it to CMC Markets PLC which has a choice of two trading platforms which were created for more advanced users. These are ‘Next Generation’ trading platform and MetaTrader, providing cutting-edge technology. Plus500 is more casual, so it’s a great platform for beginner and intermediate traders.

Another comparison I would say, that CMC Markets PLC is in other industries such as offering forex broker services, with some commodities and has access to a wide range of share/forex instruments available. Plus500 has more of a focus on their CFD product range.

Although, Plus500 has made an acquisition of buying Cunningham and Cunningham Trading Systems (US commodities) for $30m so they are clearly trying to diversify away from pure CFD products.

**Looking Forward**

&gt;*David Zruia, Chief Executive Officer, commented:* Our vision is to enable simplified, universal access to financial markets, as we start to evolve from a technology company solely focused on CFDs to a multi-asset fintech group over time. We aim to achieve this by accessing multiple growth opportunities, through organic investment in our technology and targeted M&amp;A. Specifically, we aim to expand our CFD offering geographically, launch new trading products, introduce new financial products and deepen our engagement with customers to achieve growth in the coming years.In addition, we will continue to invest in our business, with approximately $50m to be incrementally invested in R&amp;D over the next three years, designated to develop new products and services, drive innovation and scale our technology, including the establishment of a new R&amp;D centre in Israel.

Total revenue for the year was $872.5m, up 146% from the prior year (FY 2019: $354.5m), this revenue performance drove EBITDA to grow by 168% to $515.9m (FY 2019: $192.3m). Customer Churn in FY 2020 was much reduced at 30.1% (FY 2019: 64.4%) with customer loyalty remained high. Plus500 remains highly cash generative with low capital expenditure due to automation and technological advancement.

The company revenue is driven by active customers and succes in attracting new customers. The future growth is expected to be ""normalised"" after lockdown restrictions to be eased.

**On-going concern**

Plus500 recently released their annual report on 25th March 2021, mentioning the remuneration and promotions policy. The founders, Elad Even-Chen and Asaf Elimelech still have significantly higher bonuses rate compared to David Zuria (current CEO). The Sunday times quoted:

&gt;Plus500 intends to pay the special bonus to Mr Even-Chen, 34, because of his work securing “preferred technological enterprise” status for the company in Israel, which has significantly cut its tax rate and led to a $47 million tax rebate in July.

Elad Even-Chen could have connections with the Israeli government which leads to paying lower corporation tax and Plus500 currently paying 12% (*note: Corporate tax rate for Plus500 the years 2017, 2018 and 2019 was 24%, 23% and 23%, respective*).

One concern that got my attention is the EPS. The annual bonus for the Executive Directors such as the achievement for the performance measures and targets consist of EPS of 60% and the rest of 40% targets and performance Plus500 are not willing to disclose as the Board believes that they are commercially sensitive which I think is a yellow flag.

**Regulatory Risks**

Plus500 is regulated in the UK, Australia, Cyprus, New Zealand, Israel, South Africa, Singapore and the Seychelles, and it’s also available across Asia, the Middle East and the rest of the world.

The main risk depends upon the Europe regulations which can affect its product profitability. It could also affect the company’s revenue due to its price movements, foreign currency, customer credit risk and ad limitations (due to some regulations in certain countries).

In Australia, Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) announced that it is going to propose certain restrictions on sales and marketing of CFDs to retail customers. CFD regulation to be applied from 29 Mar 2021.

**Dispute between board members over the bonus scheme**

The Committee and the Board noted that there were a number of votes (35%) cast against the 2020 remuneration terms of Asaf Elimelech and Elad Even-Chen proposed at the February 2020 EGM.

Previous CEO, Asaf Elimelech resigned due to no-agreement to pay an annual bonus. It was stated that CFO Elad Even-Chen has the same bonus as Plus500’s CEO Asaf Elimelech which was set to get an annual bonus of $1.94 million. After Asaf Elimelech resignation, CTO took the place and the current CEO is David Zuria. Annual bonus has been lowered for the board members.

From the above, CMC Markets PLC trades at much higher multiples. Plus500's price to cash flow ratio is low due to the company's ability to generate high revenues during COVID times as more people stay at home and being perceived as risky due to regulations in the CFD markets.

The Operating Margin % is significantly high compared to it's peers because Plus500 has a software barrier to entry and includes strong market presence with a significant loyal customer base. This also signifies a huge moat.

The input values I chose for the DCF

**CAGR in Years 1-5**

**2%** \- Plus500 has a record financial growth driven by COVID-19, the growth expected to slow down for the next following years due to COVID-19 restrictions to be eased but also due to high regulatory risks.

I think Plus500 will still have a good financial performance of being customer-driven and solely focused on CFD's which very popular among individuals, casual trading and being able to operate in accordance with the applicable laws.

**Operating Target Margin in Year 10**

**41%** \- COVID-19 has had a big impact on margins due to people staying at home. This will level off though. Plus500 has deep engagement with customers and continue to invest in technology through organic investment. So I still expect to achieve high margins in the near future.

**Year of Convergence**

**2yr** \- This is because the short term spike from COVID-19 should level off and the margins should go back to normal.

**Sales to Capital Ratio**

**2.82** \- Plus500 has grown very rapidly with having so much cash, Plus500 has an on-going focus on attractive shareholder returns with at least 50% of profit going back to shareholders. This is the reason why Plus500 is issuing such a large percentage of dividends as they don't need to reinvest a lot into the business to grow it.

Also, it get benefits of the change in tax rate from the Israeli statutory rate (23%) to 12%.

**Probability of Failure**

**67%** \- The reason I've put a fairly high probability of failure is due to the high regulatory risks in certain countries. If CFD's are banned then Plus500 immediately loses all those customers.

**Proceeds as a Percentage of Book value**

**89%** \- If the company has to stop trading immediately because over regulations then Plus500 will have to distribute their net assets to shareholders. As Plus500 possess a lot of cash they don't have to sell it at a discounted rate.

You can see that their ROIC is crazy, this is because they have no capex and instead the majority of their spend is in marketing such as advertising. If you wanted to you could capitalize some of this R&amp;D as well.

I have estimated the shares to have a share price of **£26.98** per share.

On the **25th Apr. 2021** they traded for **£15.1** a share which gives a margin of safety of **44.04%**.

&lt;p&gt;Plus500 Ltd&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15.1&lt;/strong&gt; GBP&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;101.42m&lt;/strong&gt; Shares Outstanding&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Business Description&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus500 Ltd. develops and operates an online and mobile trading platform for individual customers to trade contracts for difference (CFDs). The company&amp;#39;s online trading and mobile platform allows its customers to trade CFDs on approximately 2,500 underlying financial instruments, including equities, indices, commodities, options, exchange-traded funds, cryptocurrencies, shares, and foreign exchange in approximately 50 countries in 32 languages. Its trading platform is accessible from various operating systems, such as Windows, iOS, Android, and Surface, as well as web browsers. The company was formerly known as Investsoft Ltd. and changed its name to Plus500 Ltd. in June 2012. Plus500 Ltd. was incorporated in 2008 and is headquartered in Haifa, Israel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Competitors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus500 is very different compared to its competitors. The platform is user-friendly and provides unlimited access to a demo account, providing the time and flexibility to learn about CFD trading. It has a customer centric approach with available 24/7 either via live chat, email or What’s App.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if we compare it to CMC Markets PLC which has a choice of two trading platforms which were created for more advanced users. These are ‘Next Generation’ trading platform and MetaTrader, providing cutting-edge technology. Plus500 is more casual, so it’s a great platform for beginner and intermediate traders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another comparison I would say, that CMC Markets PLC is in other industries such as offering forex broker services, with some commodities and has access to a wide range of share/forex instruments available. Plus500 has more of a focus on their CFD product range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although, Plus500 has made an acquisition of buying Cunningham and Cunningham Trading Systems (US commodities) for $30m so they are clearly trying to diversify away from pure CFD products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking Forward&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;David Zruia, Chief Executive Officer, commented:&lt;/em&gt; Our vision is to enable simplified, universal access to financial markets, as we start to evolve from a technology company solely focused on CFDs to a multi-asset fintech group over time. We aim to achieve this by accessing multiple growth opportunities, through organic investment in our technology and targeted M&amp;amp;A. Specifically, we aim to expand our CFD offering geographically, launch new trading products, introduce new financial products and deepen our engagement with customers to achieve growth in the coming years.In addition, we will continue to invest in our business, with approximately $50m to be incrementally invested in R&amp;amp;D over the next three years, designated to develop new products and services, drive innovation and scale our technology, including the establishment of a new R&amp;amp;D centre in Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total revenue for the year was $872.5m, up 146% from the prior year (FY 2019: $354.5m), this revenue performance drove EBITDA to grow by 168% to $515.9m (FY 2019: $192.3m). Customer Churn in FY 2020 was much reduced at 30.1% (FY 2019: 64.4%) with customer loyalty remained high. Plus500 remains highly cash generative with low capital expenditure due to automation and technological advancement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company revenue is driven by active customers and succes in attracting new customers. The future growth is expected to be &amp;quot;normalised&amp;quot; after lockdown restrictions to be eased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On-going concern&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus500 recently released their annual report on 25th March 2021, mentioning the remuneration and promotions policy. The founders, Elad Even-Chen and Asaf Elimelech still have significantly higher bonuses rate compared to David Zuria (current CEO). The Sunday times quoted:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus500 intends to pay the special bonus to Mr Even-Chen, 34, because of his work securing “preferred technological enterprise” status for the company in Israel, which has significantly cut its tax rate and led to a $47 million tax rebate in July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elad Even-Chen could have connections with the Israeli government which leads to paying lower corporation tax and Plus500 currently paying 12% (&lt;em&gt;note: Corporate tax rate for Plus500 the years 2017, 2018 and 2019 was 24%, 23% and 23%, respective&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One concern that got my attention is the EPS. The annual bonus for the Executive Directors such as the achievement for the performance measures and targets consist of EPS of 60% and the rest of 40% targets and performance Plus500 are not willing to disclose as the Board believes that they are commercially sensitive which I think is a yellow flag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regulatory Risks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus500 is regulated in the UK, Australia, Cyprus, New Zealand, Israel, South Africa, Singapore and the Seychelles, and it’s also available across Asia, the Middle East and the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main risk depends upon the Europe regulations which can affect its product profitability. It could also affect the company’s revenue due to its price movements, foreign currency, customer credit risk and ad limitations (due to some regulations in certain countries).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Australia, Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) announced that it is going to propose certain restrictions on sales and marketing of CFDs to retail customers. CFD regulation to be applied from 29 Mar 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dispute between board members over the bonus scheme&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Committee and the Board noted that there were a number of votes (35%) cast against the 2020 remuneration terms of Asaf Elimelech and Elad Even-Chen proposed at the February 2020 EGM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previous CEO, Asaf Elimelech resigned due to no-agreement to pay an annual bonus. It was stated that CFO Elad Even-Chen has the same bonus as Plus500’s CEO Asaf Elimelech which was set to get an annual bonus of $1.94 million. After Asaf Elimelech resignation, CTO took the place and the current CEO is David Zuria. Annual bonus has been lowered for the board members.&lt;/p&gt;

there are tons of books out there about value investing and investing in general. 

 im trying to make sense about what is best to read and in what particular order.

can anyone recommend me about books i should read? more importantly what is the order i should read them? (so far iv'e read - The education of value investor, Rule #1, the little book that beats the market,  The Accounting Game: Basic Accounting Fresh from the Lemonade Stand).  
i thought about reading next (in that order) - 

1. Value Investing: From Graham to Buffett and Beyond Bruce Greenwald
2. Mastering the Market Cycle: Getting the Odds on Your Side Howard Marks
3. you can be a stock market genius J.Greenblat
4. Margin of Safety Seth A Klarman
5. The intelligent investor B.Graham

718,,ValueInvesting,"Hey everyone,

I built a spreadsheet to track stocks, automatically pull data and analyze fundamentals.

**I fixed a couple of things, so if you already have a copy make yourself a fresh one!**

[**https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10MRjupIWNNAO4fdKkgW9QM\_IUpPrduHtKz\_JiS8JUUA/edit#gid=1116024769**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10MRjupIWNNAO4fdKkgW9QM_IUpPrduHtKz_JiS8JUUA/edit#gid=1116024769)

**The spreadsheet consists of two sheets:**

1. **Tracker:** A watchlist to track stocks and automatically pull financial ratios and data.
2. **Fundamental Analysis:** A way to automatically pull financial statement data, ratios and metrics for analysis.

Everything is **automated**, the only things you have to change are the **tickers** and **data points** you want to pull.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Open it, go to File and click Make a Copy**
2. **Read and follow all of the instructions on the ""Guide"" tab**

**Use the sheet in this way:**

1. Add new tickers to column A of staticData
2. Sort column A of staticData by A-Z each time you add a new ticker
3. Add the ticker you want to analyze to A1 of fundamentalAnalysis in UPPERCASE

If       you end up adding new rows to Tracker or staticData you'll need to      make  sure the formulas are applied to each column, do this like  you     would in  Excel, drag the cells down.

I have a question regarding PJT partners inc. (Ticker: PJT) 

In their 10Q, the following is stated:

**PJT Partners Inc. is the sole general partner of PJT Partners Holdings LP. PJT Partners Inc. owns less than 100% of the economic interest in PJT Partners Holdings LP, but has 100% of the voting power and controls the management of PJT Partners Holdings LP. As of March 31, 2021, the non-controlling interest was 39.0%. As the sole general partner of PJT Partners Holdings LP, PJT Partners Inc. operates and controls all of the business and affairs and consolidates the financial results of PJT Partners Holdings LP and its operating subsidiaries. The Company operates through the following subsidiaries: PJT Partners LP, PJT Partners (UK) Limited, PJT Partners (HK) Limited and PJT Partners Park Hill (Spain) A.V., S.A.U.** 

&amp;#x200B;

The public company in which I hold common stocks in is **PJT partners inc. .** I am trying to understand whether the reported fundementals in the 10Q are attributed to **PJT partners inc.** or to **PJT partners Holdings LP.** Is it possible that I hold stocks in a company that has the economic power of only 39% of the reported numbers? Or the numbers that I see in the Balance Sheet for example, represents 39% of the actual numbers?

727,,ValueInvesting,"A few simple changes to investing that I picked up over the years that you could think about. 

1. Look at stocks when markets are closed. This way if you sell or buy on impulse you have to wait until the next day and potentially get back to your senses and correct your mistake if needed. Look at your stocks as little as possible. Small changes are meaningless. It’s all about the big picture. Looking at stocks constantly may give us the impression that we have control yet the sun will keep on shining with us or without us and the people we invest in will keep on doing their job whether we watch them do it or not. Heck, farmers don’t watch each and every one of their seeds grow each minute of the day. It’s just a shortcut to insanity.

2. Ask yourself if the stock’s price is cheap in absolute terms and not in relation to future forecasts and sentiment. 

3. If a stock is down, don’t sell until one or two years have passed. Again this is to protect you again impulsiveness. 

4. If you don’t like tomato sauce with basilica in it, turn on grayscale when checking your portfolios. 

5. Before making an investment, ask yourself if you’re being humble about it. Sometimes we can get into an ego trip thinking that *we* are right about a stock pick because we’ve been analysing it a lot and thus know better than anyone else. Remember that the stock market doesn’t give 2 cents about us and we’re not special. (Fight Club)

6. Live more. A good investor should live strive to live a fulfilling life. Don’t just read finance and investment-related books. Expand your mind beyond that. Meet people (take your covid precautions), go for a hike, disappear for a week to visit a new place, heck even take up meditation. Whatever it is, expand yourself and your horizons because your wealth will keep on increasing without your assistance but your mind, spirit, happiness and body won’t unless you focus on them as well. 

7. Remember to follow your gut. Don’t invest money you will need in a few weeks, months or years. Make sure you have money left for other activities in life. Your gut will tell you when you’re investing too much money at once. If I’m not mistaken and remember my readings, the brain developed way after our gut so it shouldn’t be underestimated. (Don’t confuse gut with emotions). If you can’t sleep tight with your current investment strategy you should rethink it. 

8. Remember that you are your worst enemy. To the contrary of what economists blabber, we’re not rational most of the time so steps should be taken to counter our irrationality. Studies show that our mind is incredible at, in a way, interpreting reality as it pleases more than we realise. It can overfocus on certain aspect, negative or positive, which bias our good judgment. Remember that there’s a study that actually showed that portfolios of people who either forgot about having invested or who died have performed the best as they simply hadn’t fiddled with their portfolio nor sold anything out because the sell button suddenly felt like a rash that needed to be itched. 

9. Remain unbiased as long as possible. Start by reading the reports first before listening to what people have to say about the company. We have a natural tendency to love our first ideas and take ideas coming from people more seriously which can thus bias us towards liking a stock when we didn’t really look into the facts ourselves. If a friend wants to share an investing idea tell them to either email the idea to you or to meet up another time to discuss the company when you’ll be on the same level as them. This way you’ll be able to have an educated opinion on the company as well and avoid being biased towards liking it based on your friends liking of it. 

10. Don’t try to be smart. It is easier trying to avoid being stupid. 

I’d be interested in hearing your insights as well.

In a nutshell they are Austria's largest hydro producer and also engage in electricity trading. They have also partnered with Google and are trying out AI systems for machinery maintenance and better electricity trading.

The firm is profitable with a high margin (EBIT margin 28%), very stable with a bottom up beta of 0.43, has long term prospects, and is flexible as they can expand the grid vs production in the event of the appearance of external cheap energy sources.

The company is also reinvesting in capital projects which will fuel growth in the future. These projects are backed by research for quality control, digitization, artificial intelligence systems, trading and supply.

Future investment plans include new renewable energy generation which will amount to a profitable development of approx. **20–25%** of Verbund’s total electricity generated from onshore **wind power plants and solar power.** 

They are also engaging R&amp;D projects for **green hydrogen produced from renewable energy sources**.

**Intro:** If you're unaware of 1-800-FLOWERS than you probably live in a cave where no sun shines and it's cold and lifeless, but I'll give you a pass because you probably also believe it's an over-the-phone floral delivery service. Good news, it's not. 1-800-FLOWERS is a leading e-commerce provider of products and services designed to inspire more human expression, connection, and celebration which today reported results for its Fiscal 2021 third quarter ended March 28, 2021. This colorful description comes from the marketing department so to give a better idea, it operates in three segments: Consumer Floral; Gourmet Foods &amp; Gift Baskets; and BloomNet. The company offers a range of products, including fresh-cut flowers, floral and fruit arrangements and plants, gifts, dipped berries, popcorn, gourmet foods and gift baskets, cookies, chocolates, candies, wine, and gift-quality fruits, as well as balloons, candles, keepsake gifts, jewelry, and plush stuffed animals. Alright, that's enough- use Google if you want to know more of the basics.


**Note:** This is a *cyclical* business. If it wasn't clear to you already, I'm going to state now that their quarterly results vary based on the celebrated holidays within their time frame. For example, in the year 2020, the quarters that ended in March &amp; September had roughly the same amount of Net Revenue but the quarter that ended in June had 1.5 times that amount. The Holiday season quarter ending in December *more than doubled* that very same quarter ending in June.

**Metrics:**

1.  ROIC, as of today for the TTM, is 19.66%. Over the last 5 years, starting at 8.11%, FLWS ROIC has steadily increased and is now more than twice it was only 5 years ago. (GuruFocus.com) ROA &amp; ROE are both also currently greater than 10%, but I'm not usually as focused on those metrics. (Finviz.com)
2. Institutional Ownership is 88%. In previous posts of mine, I've mentioned that I like seeing high enough IO to inspire confidence from the big guys, but a margin large enough to allow more big guys to come in and drive the price up with bulk buying. 88% is a great spot for Institutional Ownership. (Finviz.com)
3. D/E, as of prior to this most recent earnings report, is .34. I hate seeing debt, whether it be short or long term but the upside here is that FLWS has proven how to *make lending work for them.* At any rate, they are far from their own worst enemy, but here's the hot button topic that everyone is talking about: FLWS has a 27% Short ratio. As far as I'm concerned, this is *way* too high for such a strong business, but it's more important to note that this ratio is very likely based on cyclical, quarterly moves in the stock price. In my opinion, this is a risky, but fair short term trading strategy for a cyclical business like this. I believe, based on these fundamentals, that there's way too much risk betting against FLWS, even quarterly, but Hedgies gonna Hedge. (Finviz.com)
4. PEG Ratio was at .8 at market close yesterday for the next 5 years. For the *last* 5 years, EPS grew 24% *without* emphasis on their ecommerce business. This is with a P/E ratio of only 15, I mind you. With today's quarterly report, this is only going to get stronger. If you need me to spell this out, I will- their margins are only going to get stronger from here on out AND they're still undervalued. (Finviz.com)
5. Operating Cash Flow doubled from 2019 to 2020 and then *more than doubled* from 2020 to the TTM. (Yahoo Finance)
6. As of this morning, FLWS raised their share buyback program to $40 million. This management team knows what they're doing. They're taking full advantage of the shorting a cyclical business by purchasing their own shares when *they know* the price will be undervalued. All of this value comes right back to the shareholders for free. 

**Bear Case:** No company is perfect, so it's important for me to poke holes in any potential investment I'm considering. The bear case for 1-800-FLOWERS is consumer-centric. My research talking to people about the service and products have largely revolved around the same issue: Flower quality. Despite FLWS offering many different products and services, it appears that most people I have spoken to have felt somewhat disappointed by the flowers that have been delivered. In my own personal opinion when I have used the site for flower delivery, I did not experience the same- but again, that's just my own opinion. There were plenty of positive comments made about other offerings, but consumer sentiment is a piece of the puzzle when considering supporting a company, so I've taken this into account and will continue to monitor any changes.

**Subjective Analysis:** I think FLWS has what it takes to really bloom (sorry, I had to). A track record of a strong financial foundation, growth on the horizon by way of their Bloomnet and focus on their Ecommerce presence, and the ability to do all this with great margins and leadership team that *wants* shareholders to succeed.

Biogen a drug company, stock symbol- BIIB. They are in the S&amp;P 500. I really like the management of this company, they are very shareholder friendly, and I have read a good deal about their products/research.

In 2019 they had revenues just above 14 Billion with net income of 5.8 Billion. With a market cap of only 42 Billion it's selling for less than 8 times earnings, which is very cheap compared to the 27 times earnings for the S&amp;P 500. However, with the 10 yr treasury at only 1.60 %,  stocks in general are not overvalued at all. 

Their Balance Sheet is decent for a drug company with about 2 Billion in Net Tangible Assets. 

Their main products in 2019 were 

Multiple Sclerosis Drugs:
Tecfedera - 4.4 Billion
Avonex/Plegridy - 2.1 Billion
Tysabri- 1.9 Billion

Spinal Muscular Atrophy Drugs
Spinraza- 2.1 Billuon

It has revolutionized the treatment of SMA, a disease that is devastating for children. 

Biosimilars 
3 products for a total of 730 Million

Anti-CD20 Therapuetic Programs
2.3 Billion
I believe this a partnership in which they receive some money from Rituxan, Hycela, Gayza.

The major upside with this company would be if their drug Aducanumab can get approved by the FDA. It has been a controversy because in phase 3 they ended up cancelling the trials but then later said at a high enough dose the drug does work. It would be the first drug to help slow down early Alzheimer's.  Here is an article about it. https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/07/biogens-alzheimers-drug-still-faces-uphill-battle-with-fda.html

The Company also has many other drugs in the pipeline but I am not sure about their market potential. I am not an expert by any means in these medications, but I have read a good deal and believe in the company. 

My concerns about the company are that I don't fully understand the science behind the drugs very well, it's hard for me to tell if what they're saying is bull shit or not, so I have to keep a close eye on the sales of the drugs. Also, it's looking like their current drugs have reached their sales potential, 2020 revenue and profits will be very similar to 2019. However, if earnings don't grow but stay steady it should still be a solid long term investment. The company bought back over 5 Billion of its stock in 2019 and it looks like they will buy more this year. At these prices that will really add up.  Even if earnings don't deteriorate 50-60 percent the investment should turn out satisfactory.

Again the huge upside would be if their drug for Alzheimer's gets approved. Their Ceo thinks it will. The FDA has to make a decision by March 7th 2021. They have 4 other drugs in the pipeline for Alzheimer's but this is the closest one to getting approved.

In 2020 Earnings decreased to 4 Billion due to other companies generic brand of tecifedera. But 4 billion is still a PE of around 10. They bought back 6.7 Billion of stock, with a market cap of only 42 Billion and trading at 10 PE this is huge.

Let's do this. I'll provide justification for my portfolio, but won't deep-dive into DD since I can make other posts if people are interested.

**This is not investment advice. I am not a finance professional or a financial planner. You should always conduct your own due diligence, and never invest money you cannot afford to lose.**

|Name/ticker|Portfolio allocation|Total return to-date %|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Largo Resources|41.18 %|29%|
|Westwood Holdings Group|35.6 %|14.41%|
|Snowflake Inc|8.6 %|2.8 %|
|Kraft Heinz|6.7 %|18 %|
|Nordea Bank|4 %|18 %|
|Alibaba|4 %|\-4 %|

Justifications:

Largo Resources recently listed on the Nasdaq. Prior to that, it was trading OTC and on the Toronto stock exchange, which is where I bought it from. It is a Vanadium mining company that recently has acquired the rights for a vanadium redox flow battery. I believe this to be the decade of the battery.

Vanadium redox flow batteries are not feasible for EV's, so on that front, it's not a hype stock. Instead, I see them being able to power entire communities and I believe them to be a key component when it comes to green energy. There's plenty of information on this battery technology available, so I won't go into it.

Currently, vanadium is used to strengthen steel, so i believe that as economies come out of the pandemic and construction starts ramping up, there's a lot of demand for the product. Coupled with a vertically integrated future battery technology, I see a very wide competitive moat here, both in terms of traditional industry and future battery technology.

On top of that, Largo recently paid off all of its debts and it's also sitting on top of a lot of inventory of iron ore. There's an expectation of an analyst price target increase this week, and the most optimistic analyst price target is CAD 36, currently trading at CAD 21-ish. I've steadily been increasing my position since last Fall.

&amp;#x200B;

Westwood Holdings Group is an investment boutique. I made a DD post about it here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/m6ykyl/whg\_small\_cap\_value/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/m6ykyl/whg_small_cap_value/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

&amp;#x200B;

Snowflake: Probably the most controversial in terms of value investing since it's recently listed, has a lot of hype and is not profitable and trades at several multiples of revenues.

Still, I think Snowflake has way more upside potential than downside risk. The growth is quite staggering, and I was looking for a good play in the cloud space with a product that I can understand. Snowflake's product is easy to understand. As a gross oversimplification: it's a cloud database, but seeing as how companies are flocking to it in what seems to be in droves, I think it can deliver on its promises.

Executive compensation is the only issue I currently have with it, but there's no such thing as a perfect investment.

&amp;#x200B;

Kraft Heinz: I got on the Buffet train on this one. My entry point was decent. Nothing much left to be said about this, people seem to be quite divided about it. At face value, it actually doesn't meet my main investment criteria, which is that I don't like debt. However, KHC seems to manage its debt quite well, so I have no reason to sell unless the rate at which they're paying down debt decreases or something else happens at that front.

&amp;#x200B;

Nordea Bank: This is the largest bank operating in the Nordics. As far as banks go, it isn't super leveraged and I feel like it makes sense to have a small position here.

&amp;#x200B;

Alibaba: The reach that Alibaba has when it comes to all kinds of businesses in China just makes sense to me. If I want exposure to China, BABA gives me that. The fears seem to be priced in and I think a small position makes sense.

&amp;#x200B;

Others I'm planning on buying once I free up capital and if I see good buying opportunities:

MMEDF - yes, a hype/meme stock. It's frothy after the Nasdaq listing, and while I can't put my finger on the why of it, I might open a small position here. There's just something I like about it. I was late to the party of the recent rally, but honestly, I have zero FOMO here since I think we're a ways from this being something I'll get into.

TXN - semiconductors, it's too expensive for me now, but I've had my eye on it for way too long.

ECL - Bill Gates likes it and I like it too. It's been trading at a premium for about as long as I can remember but I think that if I have the capital to allocate, I'll get in once an opportunity presents itself.

ROP - A holding company of niche technology and a dividend aristocrat, what's not to like? Until recently, I liked everything about it but it has been increasing its debt load, so I'm on the fence because of that. I had a position here earlier but I sold it. An inconsequential profit, but I really want to like this one.

Bio-Rad: Recently rallied, I've been eyeing it but haven't done any proper DD on it yet. Is next on my list of DD once I get around to it.

UPM.HE - A Finnish forestry company. This seems quite cyclical, so I might open a position if it dips, as many stocks on smaller/fringe exchanges often do.

TROW - Another investment boutique, fantastic dividend history. Makes-it-easy.

&amp;#x200B;

In closing:

On the whole, my current portfolio isn't quite as diversified as I'd like, but since many stocks are trading at such high premiums, I just put my money where I see clear upside potential. I'll buy some dips when they present themselves. Still, as far as industries and geography are concerned, on that front I'm happy with my diversification. Tech is great and all, but I also want to control for beta at least a little bit.

&lt;p&gt;ECL - Bill Gates likes it and I like it too. It&amp;#39;s been trading at a premium for about as long as I can remember but I think that if I have the capital to allocate, I&amp;#39;ll get in once an opportunity presents itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ROP - A holding company of niche technology and a dividend aristocrat, what&amp;#39;s not to like? Until recently, I liked everything about it but it has been increasing its debt load, so I&amp;#39;m on the fence because of that. I had a position here earlier but I sold it. An inconsequential profit, but I really want to like this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bio-Rad: Recently rallied, I&amp;#39;ve been eyeing it but haven&amp;#39;t done any proper DD on it yet. Is next on my list of DD once I get around to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPM.HE - A Finnish forestry company. This seems quite cyclical, so I might open a position if it dips, as many stocks on smaller/fringe exchanges often do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TROW - Another investment boutique, fantastic dividend history. Makes-it-easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In closing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the whole, my current portfolio isn&amp;#39;t quite as diversified as I&amp;#39;d like, but since many stocks are trading at such high premiums, I just put my money where I see clear upside potential. I&amp;#39;ll buy some dips when they present themselves. Still, as far as industries and geography are concerned, on that front I&amp;#39;m happy with my diversification. Tech is great and all, but I also want to control for beta at least a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe investing big into high conviction stocks that allow me to sleep well at night.&lt;/p&gt;

793,,ValueInvesting,"I would highly recommend that everyone here read Nick's Sleep's investor letters. I first heard about these letters mentioned in an interview that Mohnish Pabrai gave. Nick Sleep is a value investor and I think his letters are full of very valuable insights: [https://igyfoundation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Full_Collection_Nomad_Letters_.pdf](https://igyfoundation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Full_Collection_Nomad_Letters_.pdf)

One of Nick Sleep's biggest and most profitable investments was in Amazon. From the letters, I believe that he started to build a position in Amazon starting around 2005. He doesn't give specifics around his valuation methodology for Amazon, so I decided to go back and look at Amazon's 10-K from 2007 and try to figure out how one could have valued the company at that time. [https://www.annualreports.com/HostedData/AnnualReportArchive/a/NASDAQ_AMZN_2007.pdf](https://www.annualreports.com/HostedData/AnnualReportArchive/a/NASDAQ_AMZN_2007.pdf)

As I see it, in 2007 the basic math for the company was this: they are growing sales at a steady rate of 20% per year and their profit margins are 3% (not bad for retail). Their market cap was $39 billion and they made $15 billion in sales in 2007. With a 3% margin, this $15 billion translates to something like $450 million in income.

If I assume that Amazon continues to execute flawlessly and grows sales at a 20% compounding rate for the next 5 years, my sales end up $37 billion and income at $1.1 billion (assuming 3% margins).

This means that in 2007 you were buying $1 of Amazon profits for $82 and if you assume they continue to execute perfectly over 5 years, they are still at a P/E of 35.

I know you could use FCF instead of profits, but even that doesn't help much. FCF ends up around $1billion in 2007, so you are still talking about a P/FCF of 40. Also, for Amazon at the time the capital expenditures that are subtracted for the FCF are needed for their growth, so it actually doesn't seem appropriate to me to deduct the capex and then build a model with assumed growth.

Looking back we all know what happened. They continued to grow and it happened not just over a 5 year period, but a 15 year period and Amazon is still growing today. But I just find it so hard to make something like a 15 year growth projection. There are so many things that could go wrong! Even making a 5 year growth projection seems like a complete stab in the dark.

I am unsure if anyone is familiar with [https://tracktak.com/](https://tracktak.com/), but it is a tool that creates DCF analysis based on Aswath Damodaran's teachings. I am new to using tracktak so I was wondering if anyone has any experience using this tool.  

I have trouble understanding the 'value driving inputs' and the 'optional inputs'. Does Aswath Damodaran have specific videos/articles that describe these inputs? Or, is there perhaps, is there a tutorial video on using tracktak?

796,,ValueInvesting,"Hello r/ValueInvesting,

after investing in ETFs for a while, I decided to try a more active way of investing in the stock market.
Inspired from the things I read about Graham's theories and a lot of other posts on this subreddit, I tried to find some good stocks to invest in.

In the following post, I'd like to share with you my (beginner's) approach of finding this stocks, in the hope to get some feedback and criticism:

**1. NASDAQ Screener**

My first step was to get a list of companies. After searching the internet for a while, I found out about the NASDAQ stock screener.
My search criteria:
- Market cap &gt; $2b.
- Regions: Australia &amp; South Pacific, Europe, North America

I made the decision to choose this criteria to reduce my risk: I didn't want to invest in small caps companies, because there is less information on the internet about these companies. Furthermore, I didn't want to invest in emerging countries, because I don't know a lot about their politics and society.

Result: 1779 companies

**2. Search companies that *might* be undervalued**

My first screening-criteria is the p/e-ratio.

For this step, I (probably) used the most simple method, the GOOGLEFINANCE-API in Google Sheets:

```
=GOOGLEFINANCE(""TICKER"", ""pe"")
```

When I couldn't get data with that method, I deleted the respective company, because I simply do not have the time to search for this data manually. With that step, 1211 companies stayed on my list.

Now, I searched for companies with p/e &lt; 15, to find companies that *might* be undervalued. After that, I had 191 stocks on the list.


**3. Looking at other metrics**

After having a look at the p/e-ratio, I looked at the following metrics:

* debt/equity-ratio &lt; 0.5
* ROE &gt; 15%
* p/b &lt; 1.5 OR (p/b) * (p/e) &lt; 22

While the idea behind looking at the first ratio was to reduce my risk, the second and third ratio was to further look at the possible undervaluation of the respective stock. My main source for this step was [finviz.com](https://finviz.com/).

After this step, only 11 stocks stayed on my list.

**4. Looking at the earnings-history**

For this last 11 stocks, I then looked at the earnings-history. For me it was important that
* the current eps are 1/3 higher than the eps 10 years ago.
* that the eps was at maximum 2 times negative in the last 10 years.

I found this data on [financials.morningstar.com](http://financials.morningstar.com/ratios/r.html?t=aapl).

This deleted one stock from my stock, so that I now have 10 stocks to invest in:

* AFL
* ALL
* BIO
* FAF
* FBC
* FNF
* HTH
* LEN
* MCY
* WTM


What do you think about this process and the found companies? Where can I improve?

816,,ValueInvesting,"Reviewing notes from Peter Lynch confused me a bit when looking at when to buy a growth stock. 

Lynch mentions the earnings line (at a p/e of 15) compared to the stock price. When the price line dips below the earnings line, it is considered a good time to buy.

BUT... he also mentions the famous PEG ratio.... a stock that is fairly priced will have a p/e that matches it's EPS growth rate. 

&amp;#x200B;

The question is...if there is a situation where these measurements are opposite, which do you choose to go by? For example, what if the earnings line at a p/e of 15 is considerably below the price line but the EPS growth rate for the last 5 years is well above the p/e at the same time? According to Lynch's writings, the price would be overpriced and undervalued at the same time?

## What is AFLAC?

As per their 10-K report, AFLAC is:

***Aflac Incorporated*** *(the Parent Company) was incorporated in 1973 under the laws of the state of Georgia. The Parent Company and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Company) provide financial protection to more than 50 million people worldwide.* ***The Company’s principal business is supplemental health and life insurance products*** *with the goal to provide customers the best value in supplemental insurance products* ***in the United States (U.S.) and Japan.*** *When a policyholder or insured gets sick or hurt, the Company pays cash benefits fairly and promptly for eligible claims. Throughout its 65 year history, the Company’s supplemental insurance policies have given policyholders the opportunity to focus on recovery, not financial stress.*

In other words, **AFLAC is an American Insurance Company operating primarily in the United States and Japan.**

Japan in fact provides around 2/3rds of their revenue via their subsidiary AFLAC Japan.

Their business model involves collecting premiums from their clients, and paying some cash directly to them (or their beneficiaries) if their clients have some health issues or pass away.

**They make money by paying out less than they collect, as well as by getting some investment returns on the premiums they have collected.**

This is a boring, simple and easy to understand business model, and as long as they didn’t massively miscalculate how much money they will have to pay out to their customers, there isn’t really a lot that can go wrong.

In short, AFLAC is the type of business where regular and consistent revenues and profits are made, which is ideal for a long term buy and hold investor.

## Strengths and Weaknesses

No company is perfect, and every company has their own strengths and weaknesses.

AFLAC is no different, and the way they are structured and the markets they participate in make some of those strengths clear, and some of the weaknesses also.

## Strengths:

* Insurance is a highly regulated field, which reduces new competition
* Enduring Competitive advantages have allowed it to capture 25% of the Japanese health and life insurance market
* Low payout ratio permits regular dividend increases into the future
* They have demonstrated a long standing commitment to returning capital to shareholders via dividends and share buybacks

## Weaknesses:

* High exposure to the Japanese Market and Yen-USD currency fluctuations
* Complex regulatory environment means the company is exposed to political risks and caps potential profits
* Covid and other significant disasters may heavily impact the company
* Stagnating revenue and earnings in the past 10 years

That last bit maybe be a bit of a sticking point for most investors, after all, few people want to invest in a company that is making less money today than it made 10 year ago.

Indeed, if your investment objectives require aggressive and continuous growth of revenue and bottom line, then I don’t believe AFLAC is the company for you.

But for someone who is happy to get a steady and consistent business, at a price that is below what i believe is their fair value, then AFLAC may be the stock for you.

What do i mean by that? Well, let’s have a look at their numbers…

## Income Statement

Let’s see the key numbers over the past 10 years:

https://preview.redd.it/j4hcouw2q5v61.png?width=1438&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=739b453f0b286de5e1821084a95102d9a4ae99c4

A bit too confusing? Let’s make some charts:

https://preview.redd.it/a7io7qh4q5v61.png?width=1003&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72340fc2e74067b4186a2d5649f7cc4cfe20d2c0

So **revenue has been pretty flat**, having peaked in 2012 at around 25 Billion USD. That’s also around the time that the yen had some pretty severe appreciation against the USD:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/m5tcj686q5v61.png?width=925&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77d8d5ce9b0ed28910261480ad1c94dae26e5bff

Given that most of the companies revenues and profits come from Japan, where 2/3rds of its business is made, it’s fairly **safe to say that the exchange rates played a major role in the revenues being flat.**

That being said, the company has been **consistently profitable throughout,** doubling its net earnings over this 10 year period.

Another important thing to keep track of, is the interest expense. Companies with high interest expenses are usually heavily leveraged, which isn’t good for long term investment risk adjusted returns.

In general, low long term debt is a good indication of a company with a durable competitive advantage, and **AFLAC has consistently kept their debt expenditures at around 1% of revenue.**

Their **margins are also looking very good**. Generally speaking companies with pre-tax profit margins consistently above 20% have some sort of competitive advantage that make them profitable to own as I [discussed this in a previous post](https://tiagodias.substack.com/p/the-search-for-a-durable-competitive).

The fact that AFLAC has managed to **consistently keep their margins around a very healthy 18.1% is a very good indication** that the company has an above average competitive advantage.

Let’s have a look at their “Per Share” Metrics:

https://preview.redd.it/3st7yv48q5v61.png?width=1417&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b75001c48e6e238b9cab61603515d78be234745

So their per share earnings have **consistently increasing**, and they have been **buying back shares every year.**

Buying back shares can be both good and back. It can be a way to transfer wealth to shareholders without it being taxed, or it can be a way for management to financially engineer their way into bonuses or extra compensation.

In this particular case, I’m not too concerned. The business is stable, and the buybacks look like they are a long standing commitment to returning capital to shareholders in a tax efficient way.

That being said, we now have 716 192 million shares outstanding, but we started with 473 085 million… What happened in 2018?

The answer is simple, there was a [2-for-1 stock split in 2018](https://investors.aflac.com/stock/stock-dividend-split-history/default.aspx). Nothing out of the ordinary, it just means their stock became so expensive that the company decided to split it so new investors wouldn’t have to drop $100+ just to get a share.

This means that someone who bought 1 share in 2010 at $4.92 earnings per share, would effectively be earning $13.34 per share.

That’s a **CAGR of 10.49%,** not too bad for a company whose revenues and earnings have been stagnant since 2012 due to currency headwinds!

## Balance Sheet

Here’s the balance sheet as of December 31st 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/jc731zcaq5v61.png?width=530&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99d2e9f2a532dd1fc41a71d1707dfe7b842c8719

There’s a lot to unpack here, but lets keep it simple and look at the key numbers i highlighted.

https://preview.redd.it/zxbk24ibq5v61.png?width=506&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e1490ca37f6fcda31c78ea9d1a70653bebc6070

Here you can see the assets, these are things the company owns and that it can sell for some cash.

The first thing you’ll notice in the assets is that the vast majority of AFLAC assets are in the section labelled “**Total Investments and Cash**”. Insurance companies are usually required to keep enough cash in either cash, or low risk assets such as government bonds.

These are low return on investment assets, however they have the benefit of being highly liquid. That is, they can very quickly and very easily be turned into cash on hand without any major loss of value in doing so.

What this effectively means is that **90% of AFLAC assets are either in cash, or as close to cash as you can get.**

When you buy AFLAC, you’re not just buying a profitable company, **you’re also buying a pile of cash.**

How big is that pile? Well, to find that out we need to have a look at the liabilities:

How big is that pile? Well, to find that out we need to have a look at the liabilities:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/78tp45deq5v61.png?width=505&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6152dff663af7be9d65696cc4dbdc89486fe06e2

In **yellow**, you can see the **total policy liabilities**, this is essentially money that the company owes its clients as a result of the policies that it sold. In a way, you can think of this as the cost of the goods (policies) it sold, and higher amounts here, generally indicates more business being made.

In **light orange**, you can see the **notes payable and lease obligations**. This is essentially the companies long term debt, and you can see that its only a very small amount of all of their liabilities.

In fact, if you compare it with its net earnings, we can see that **AFLAC can pay off all of its long term debts in only a couple of years** if it really needs to.

This is a very encouraging sign, because companies with a durable competitive advantage generally don’t need to make use of large amounts of long term debt.

Finally in **dark orange**, we see the total liabilities, that is, everything that the company owes.

With this we can now calculate just how big that pile of cash on our balance sheet is really ours, and which part has to be used to pay our debts:

https://preview.redd.it/ep9071ngq5v61.png?width=434&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15a579b50ee56f6d3f1ef81427067de2a102f0f1

So **when we buy AFLAC, we’re also buying a pile of 18 Billion US Dollars!**

When we consider that its market cap right now is 35 Billion dollars, we can see that about **half of the cost of buying AFLAC is effectively refunded immediately!**

In essence, we’re buying the business, its earning power, and all of its non-cash assets for around 17 Billion dollars! That’s about as much money as the company earns in 3 years!

Let’s check out the rest of the Shareholders Equity:

https://preview.redd.it/dkvlz14jq5v61.png?width=511&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2942fc99cdb66c8e93e5e084738d65b9375c43c1

See that **retained earnings**? That’s how much money the company earned, and that it chose to reinvest in the business.

The fact that it makes up the bulk of the shareholders equity means the company has been very profitable indeed.

The **Treasury Stock** might look bad, with a big negative 15 billion number on it, but it’s actually a good thing! That’s 15 billion that was returned directly to the owners!

Overall the total shareholders equity is 33 Billion, which is very close to its current market cap. This means that **AFLAC is trading very close to its book value.**

This is usually indicative of a company in distress, after all, if a company is trading close to the cost of its assets… Doesn’t that mean the market isn’t valuing its business at all?

Let’s have a look at the values over time:

https://preview.redd.it/kplwsmclq5v61.png?width=476&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c53c76702e55db5e5b5ed35221792c368a2094e

So the **cash they have on hand has been increasing over time**, which is pretty good.

https://preview.redd.it/77zzy7omq5v61.png?width=620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e2ab74f854077a31e1750322350db88d6577fccd

Their **long term debt has been increasing** as well, though its still low enough to be manageable.

What about their shareholders equity?

https://preview.redd.it/zeqc3nynq5v61.png?width=620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=150451851bfacb278d7960b5664f444c9ed5907c

Their treasury stock has been decreasing, which means **they have been buying back their own stock regularly.**

In fact, those regular buybacks seem to have started around 2012, which coincides with that high watermark in revenues. So it looks like they have been distributing those earnings to shareholders.

https://preview.redd.it/6odhanlpq5v61.png?width=617&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce761c2f70fe4e05acef1783c6f18b9c61417a57

Their **retained earnings has been increasing steadily** as well, which means they have been profitable throughout, and have not spent all of their earnings on buybacks or dividends.

https://preview.redd.it/95j7a5zqq5v61.png?width=617&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c7b8dd43a486c79f76c3aaa5645215ffc622567

Accordingly their **shareholders equity has been on the up and up, more than doubling during this past decade.**

https://preview.redd.it/q306btbsq5v61.png?width=476&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3dd315768db0aaa89855753ceb7f1a48bed64d3d

## What’s with this valuation?

How can this be? AFLAC is clearly a profitable company, in fact, in the 10 years we’ve seen it hasn’t posted a single loss and its margins have been a steady 18%.

And yet, the market is valuing it at close to its book value. Hell, a few months ago it was valuing it at below the cash it had in the bank!

What is up with this?

Honestly, I don’t know.

My best guess is that because **AFLAC isn’t a high flying tech stock,** and is heavily dependent on a foreign market whose demographic prospects aren’t the best, most investors simply overlook it.

Insurance isn’t a sexy industry like self-driving cars, nor is it as profitable as selling 1000$ iPhones, but to me that’s fine.

I don’t want sexy. I don’t like high flying tech stocks that never turned a profit.

**All I want is a nice, steady company that regularly pays me an increasing stream of income, and whose prospects I feel are bright.**

As far as I can see, **AFLAC is such a company**, so now we just need to calculate the point in which the price that we pay for AFLAC is lower than the value AFLAC provides.

We will do that in the next post, where we will take all of the data here, and make some simple calculations to come up with what I feel is a fair valuation for AFLAC.

&lt;h2&gt;What is AFLAC?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As per their 10-K report, AFLAC is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aflac Incorporated&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(the Parent Company) was incorporated in 1973 under the laws of the state of Georgia.

&lt;li&gt;Enduring Competitive advantages have allowed it to capture 25% of the Japanese health and life insurance market&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low payout ratio permits regular dividend increases into the future&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They have demonstrated a long standing commitment to returning capital to shareholders via dividends and share buybacks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Weaknesses:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High exposure to the Japanese Market and Yen-USD currency fluctuations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complex regulatory environment means the company is exposed to political risks and caps potential profits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Covid and other significant disasters may heavily impact the company&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stagnating revenue and earnings in the past 10 years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That last bit maybe be a bit of a sticking point for most investors, after all, few people want to invest in a company that is making less money today than it made 10 year ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, if your investment objectives require aggressive and continuous growth of revenue and bottom line, then I don’t believe AFLAC is the company for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for someone who is happy to get a steady and consistent business, at a price that is below what i believe is their fair value, then AFLAC may be the stock for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do i mean by that? Well, let’s have a look at their numbers…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Income Statement&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s see the key numbers over the past 10 years:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/j4hcouw2q5v61.png?width=1438&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=739b453f0b286de5e1821084a95102d9a4ae99c4""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/j4hcouw2q5v61.png?width=1438&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=739b453f0b286de5e1821084a95102d9a4ae99c4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bit too confusing? Let’s make some charts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/a7io7qh4q5v61.png?width=1003&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=72340fc2e74067b4186a2d5649f7cc4cfe20d2c0""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/a7io7qh4q5v61.png?width=1003&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=72340fc2e74067b4186a2d5649f7cc4cfe20d2c0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So &lt;strong&gt;revenue has been pretty flat&lt;/strong&gt;, having peaked in 2012 at around 25 Billion USD. That’s also around the time that the yen had some pretty severe appreciation against the USD:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/m5tcj686q5v61.png?width=925&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=77d8d5ce9b0ed28910261480ad1c94dae26e5bff""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/m5tcj686q5v61.png?width=925&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=77d8d5ce9b0ed28910261480ad1c94dae26e5bff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that most of the companies revenues and profits come from Japan, where 2/3rds of its business is made, it’s fairly &lt;strong&gt;safe to say that the exchange rates played a major role in the revenues being flat.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, the company has been &lt;strong&gt;consistently profitable throughout,&lt;/strong&gt; doubling its net earnings over this 10 year period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important thing to keep track of, is the interest expense. Companies with high interest expenses are usually heavily leveraged, which isn’t good for long term investment risk adjusted returns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, low long term debt is a good indication of a company with a durable competitive advantage, and &lt;strong&gt;AFLAC has consistently kept their debt expenditures at around 1% of revenue.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their &lt;strong&gt;margins are also looking very good&lt;/strong&gt;. Generally speaking companies with pre-tax profit margins consistently above 20% have some sort of competitive advantage that make them profitable to own as I &lt;a href=""https://tiagodias.substack.com/p/the-search-for-a-durable-competitive""&gt;discussed this in a previous post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that AFLAC has managed to &lt;strong&gt;consistently keep their margins around a very healthy 18.1% is a very good indication&lt;/strong&gt; that the company has an above average competitive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s have a look at their “Per Share” Metrics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/3st7yv48q5v61.png?width=1417&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=7b75001c48e6e238b9cab61603515d78be234745""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/3st7yv48q5v61.png?width=1417&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=7b75001c48e6e238b9cab61603515d78be234745&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So their per share earnings have &lt;strong&gt;consistently increasing&lt;/strong&gt;, and they have been &lt;strong&gt;buying back shares every year.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buying back shares can be both good and back. It can be a way to transfer wealth to shareholders without it being taxed, or it can be a way for management to financially engineer their way into bonuses or extra compensation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this particular case, I’m not too concerned. The business is stable, and the buybacks look like they are a long standing commitment to returning capital to shareholders in a tax efficient way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, we now have 716 192 million shares outstanding, but we started with 473 085 million… What happened in 2018?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is simple, there was a &lt;a href=""https://investors.aflac.com/stock/stock-dividend-split-history/default.aspx""&gt;2-for-1 stock split in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. Nothing out of the ordinary, it just means their stock became so expensive that the company decided to split it so new investors wouldn’t have to drop $100+ just to get a share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that someone who bought 1 share in 2010 at $4.92 earnings per share, would effectively be earning $13.34 per share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a &lt;strong&gt;CAGR of 10.49%,&lt;/strong&gt; not too bad for a company whose revenues and earnings have been stagnant since 2012 due to currency headwinds!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Balance Sheet&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the balance sheet as of December 31st 2020:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/jc731zcaq5v61.png?width=530&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=99d2e9f2a532dd1fc41a71d1707dfe7b842c8719""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/jc731zcaq5v61.png?width=530&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=99d2e9f2a532dd1fc41a71d1707dfe7b842c8719&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot to unpack here, but lets keep it simple and look at the key numbers i highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/zxbk24ibq5v61.png?width=506&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=1e1490ca37f6fcda31c78ea9d1a70653bebc6070""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/zxbk24ibq5v61.png?width=506&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=1e1490ca37f6fcda31c78ea9d1a70653bebc6070&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here you can see the assets, these are things the company owns and that it can sell for some cash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing you’ll notice in the assets is that the vast majority of AFLAC assets are in the section labelled “&lt;strong&gt;Total Investments and Cash&lt;/strong&gt;”. Insurance companies are usually required to keep enough cash in either cash, or low risk assets such as government bonds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are low return on investment assets, however they have the benefit of being highly liquid. That is, they can very quickly and very easily be turned into cash on hand without any major loss of value in doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this effectively means is that &lt;strong&gt;90% of AFLAC assets are either in cash, or as close to cash as you can get.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you buy AFLAC, you’re not just buying a profitable company, &lt;strong&gt;you’re also buying a pile of cash.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How big is that pile? Well, to find that out we need to have a look at the liabilities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here you can see the assets, these are things the company owns and that it can sell for some cash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing you’ll notice in the assets is that the vast majority of AFLAC assets are in the section labelled “&lt;strong&gt;Total Investments and Cash&lt;/strong&gt;”. Insurance companies are usually required to keep enough cash in either cash, or low risk assets such as government bonds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are low return on investment assets, however they have the benefit of being highly liquid. That is, they can very quickly and very easily be turned into cash on hand without any major loss of value in doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this effectively means is that &lt;strong&gt;90% of AFLAC assets are either in cash, or as close to cash as you can get.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you buy AFLAC, you’re not just buying a profitable company, &lt;strong&gt;you’re also buying a pile of cash.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How big is that pile? Well, to find that out we need to have a look at the liabilities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/78tp45deq5v61.png?width=505&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=6152dff663af7be9d65696cc4dbdc89486fe06e2""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/78tp45deq5v61.png?width=505&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=6152dff663af7be9d65696cc4dbdc89486fe06e2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;yellow&lt;/strong&gt;, you can see the &lt;strong&gt;total policy liabilities&lt;/strong&gt;, this is essentially money that the company owes its clients as a result of the policies that it sold. In a way, you can think of this as the cost of the goods (policies) it sold, and higher amounts here, generally indicates more business being made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;light orange&lt;/strong&gt;, you can see the &lt;strong&gt;notes payable and lease obligations&lt;/strong&gt;. This is essentially the companies long term debt, and you can see that its only a very small amount of all of their liabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, if you compare it with its net earnings, we can see that &lt;strong&gt;AFLAC can pay off all of its long term debts in only a couple of years&lt;/strong&gt; if it really needs to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a very encouraging sign, because companies with a durable competitive advantage generally don’t need to make use of large amounts of long term debt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally in &lt;strong&gt;dark orange&lt;/strong&gt;, we see the total liabilities, that is, everything that the company owes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this we can now calculate just how big that pile of cash on our balance sheet is really ours, and which part has to be used to pay our debts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/ep9071ngq5v61.png?width=434&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=15a579b50ee56f6d3f1ef81427067de2a102f0f1""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/ep9071ngq5v61.png?width=434&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=15a579b50ee56f6d3f1ef81427067de2a102f0f1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So &lt;strong&gt;when we buy AFLAC, we’re also buying a pile of 18 Billion US Dollars!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we consider that its market cap right now is 35 Billion dollars, we can see that about &lt;strong&gt;half of the cost of buying AFLAC is effectively refunded immediately!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In essence, we’re buying the business, its earning power, and all of its non-cash assets for around 17 Billion dollars! That’s about as much money as the company earns in 3 years!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s check out the rest of the Shareholders Equity:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/dkvlz14jq5v61.png?width=511&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=2942fc99cdb66c8e93e5e084738d65b9375c43c1""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/dkvlz14jq5v61.png?width=511&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=2942fc99cdb66c8e93e5e084738d65b9375c43c1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See that &lt;strong&gt;retained earnings&lt;/strong&gt;? That’s how much money the company earned, and that it chose to reinvest in the business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that it makes up the bulk of the shareholders equity means the company has been very profitable indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Treasury Stock&lt;/strong&gt; might look bad, with a big negative 15 billion number on it, but it’s actually a good thing! That’s 15 billion that was returned directly to the owners!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall the total shareholders equity is 33 Billion, which is very close to its current market cap. This means that &lt;strong&gt;AFLAC is trading very close to its book value.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is usually indicative of a company in distress, after all, if a company is trading close to the cost of its assets… Doesn’t that mean the market isn’t valuing its business at all?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s have a look at the values over time:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/kplwsmclq5v61.png?width=476&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=2c53c76702e55db5e5b5ed35221792c368a2094e""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/kplwsmclq5v61.png?width=476&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=2c53c76702e55db5e5b5ed35221792c368a2094e&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the &lt;strong&gt;cash they have on hand has been increasing over time&lt;/strong&gt;, which is pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/77zzy7omq5v61.png?width=620&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e2ab74f854077a31e1750322350db88d6577fccd""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/77zzy7omq5v61.png?width=620&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e2ab74f854077a31e1750322350db88d6577fccd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their &lt;strong&gt;long term debt has been increasing&lt;/strong&gt; as well, though its still low enough to be manageable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about their shareholders equity?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/zeqc3nynq5v61.png?width=620&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=150451851bfacb278d7960b5664f444c9ed5907c""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/zeqc3nynq5v61.png?width=620&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=150451851bfacb278d7960b5664f444c9ed5907c&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their treasury stock has been decreasing, which means &lt;strong&gt;they have been buying back their own stock regularly.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, those regular buybacks seem to have started around 2012, which coincides with that high watermark in revenues. So it looks like they have been distributing those earnings to shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/6odhanlpq5v61.png?width=617&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ce761c2f70fe4e05acef1783c6f18b9c61417a57""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/6odhanlpq5v61.png?width=617&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ce761c2f70fe4e05acef1783c6f18b9c61417a57&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their &lt;strong&gt;retained earnings has been increasing steadily&lt;/strong&gt; as well, which means they have been profitable throughout, and have not spent all of their earnings on buybacks or dividends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/95j7a5zqq5v61.png?width=617&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=3c7b8dd43a486c79f76c3aaa5645215ffc622567""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/95j7a5zqq5v61.png?width=617&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=3c7b8dd43a486c79f76c3aaa5645215ffc622567&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accordingly their &lt;strong&gt;shareholders equity has been on the up and up, more than doubling during this past decade.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/q306btbsq5v61.png?width=476&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=3dd315768db0aaa89855753ceb7f1a48bed64d3d""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/q306btbsq5v61.png?width=476&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=3dd315768db0aaa89855753ceb7f1a48bed64d3d&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What’s with this valuation?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can this be? AFLAC is clearly a profitable company, in fact, in the 10 years we’ve seen it hasn’t posted a single loss and its margins have been a steady 18%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet, the market is valuing it at close to its book value. Hell, a few months ago it was valuing it at below the cash it had in the bank!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is up with this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My best guess is that because &lt;strong&gt;AFLAC isn’t a high flying tech stock,&lt;/strong&gt; and is heavily dependent on a foreign market whose demographic prospects aren’t the best, most investors simply overlook it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Insurance isn’t a sexy industry like self-driving cars, nor is it as profitable as selling 1000$ iPhones, but to me that’s fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t want sexy. I don’t like high flying tech stocks that never turned a profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All I want is a nice, steady company that regularly pays me an increasing stream of income, and whose prospects I feel are bright.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as I can see, &lt;strong&gt;AFLAC is such a company&lt;/strong&gt;, so now we just need to calculate the point in which the price that we pay for AFLAC is lower than the value AFLAC provides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will do that in the next post, where we will take all of the data here, and make some simple calculations to come up with what I feel is a fair valuation for AFLAC.&lt;/p&gt;

Disclosure: I own 100,000 shares with a group. 

Joann Stores is an arts and crafts retailer; it is the only pure-play because Michael's was just purchased by the Apollo Group for $6 Billion, including debt.  I want to give you the rundown as I have been following this space for about 15 years (on a high level, not an industry exec or anything like that).  However, I remember when AC Moore's arts and crafts were public, if anyone remembers that.  Anyway, some bullet points show a bit of a timeline and some catalysts as to why I think this stock can quickly go to $20 to $30 within a year.

The company has 855 locations nationwide and seems to be shrinking going forward as they closed down 12 sites last year and opened 0.

16% of their revenues is ""omnichannel,"" which is online but can be picked up at stores, etc. This was a 194% improvement from 2019. 

The company owns an online tutorial business called CreativeBug.com, very underutilized in my opinion and should expand its business reach.

The company was acquired in 2011 for $1.6 Billion when it had no debt and is now at $400 million market cap but with $800mm in debt.

Leonard Green, the private equity firm, extracted over ten years $2 to $3 Billion from cash flow since the acquisition, via debt and operating cash flow. 

PE firm loaded about $1 billion in debt and was able to buy a good chunk of that back at an average of 43 cents of the dollar, fucking ruthless if you ask me.  They made the company so cash-constrained with debt that it worried debt investors so much that they ended up buying back some of the debt for as low as 38 cents on the dollar.  Now that they are public, they can't do these types of deals since a PE firm can't just funnel the money to buy back debt cheap; talk about screwing bond investors. 

The investment bankers mispriced IPO.  PE firm wanted $15 to $17 and got $12 since the demand book was pretty light. Yet, 6 WallStreet analysts released price targets of $17 to $27. I don’t put weight in their price targets but when I did the numbers myself I think the range is about right.

The company was very profitable in 2020, given the 25% revenue growth from the pandemic. Still, the costs increased $70 million due to China tariffs and $60 million due to COVID-related labor costs, so the business could have been even more profitable.

The company is paying a 40 cents a quarterly share dividend which makes it out to 3.33% a year.  You may ask why a company with a lot of debt wants to give such a high dividend, and the answer is that Wall Street is not providing these types of retailers a high P/E multiple. Michael's was sold for 9x 2022 Earnings (and was bought out, so what does that say, private equity firms don't spend $6 billion to lose money). Retailers like this historically have traded between 10 to 20 times next year's earnings given their stable growth and their operating margins and JAS is trading at around 4x 2022 earnings, a bargain.

This business does not grow a lot; it is mature and somewhat saturated.  There are about three major players and a bunch of mom-and-pop shops.  The largest is Michael's and Hobby Lobby and then Joann, but there is also stuff sold on Amazon, Wal-mart, etc. but just the basic stuff.  The arts and crafts consumer is pretty sticky, and they like to go to stores and talk to the people working there and touch and feel the products they buy.  This business will be hard to be 100% online; like furniture shopping, it never will be 100% online.

I would give the management team a C+ concerning the execution of the business.  I don't give it an A or B because an A+ management team can grow the business AND increase cash flow. The management team is cash flow driven (their bonus compensation is based on how much EBITDA they generate) and not towards growth or new opportunities, which is what a lot of stockholders want, growth. The compensation should be based on revenue growth, cash flow, dividend growth, and profitability vs. just one metric. So, for example, bonus given if the business grows 10% a year, operating margins are 10%, X amount of debt is paid off, X amount of dividends are paid, and EPS is at least 10 to 20% higher. I understand why the bonus is only tied to EBITDA because they were owned by a PE firm and were too cash constrained to not look at new vehicles of growth such as a competitor to ETSY. 25% of the Joann customers sell the stuff they create on EBAY and ETSY; if this isn't a fucking WAKE THE FUCK UP call to launch a competing service, I don't know what is.

However, that seems too fucking hard these days for management that like to make a lot of money for doing nothing. So, I can only keep dreaming for the day we have shareholder-friendly management compensation bonuses, etc.  If the store managers are given rewards based on a few metrics, so should the C-suite. 

Joann has a 71 million customer database and tens of millions of e-mails that seem like a few years ago. They figure out they can sell online 3x the number of products than within the store, thus creating better margins and growth; at least the management team figured that out.  

I have modeled a ten-year forecast for the business, I know many of you may not want to own this for that long, but it gives me a perspective of where the company is going and what the business can do.  I am pretty conservative in my models because I would be approximately correct than precisely wrong, and being conservative help. 

In my model, I have assumed the following:

1.      Topline revenues will grow about 2% per year for ten years.
a.      Assumed they decrease store count by 15 stores a year consistently for ten years. This will drop revenues but should increase profit margins.
b.      Assumed 10% growth rate per year of omni-channel (online) for the next ten years.
c.       Assumed NO Etsy competitor-like business.  
2.      Operating margins improve from 6% to 11% over ten years.
3.      The company can continue to puke cash and increase dividends 10% a year.
4.      Can be debt-free within 5 to 8 years. It depends on what it wants to do with all the cash flow it generates, but if the P/E multiples in the space are not being rewarded, they can be more aggressive in giving out dividends. I say this because Michaels had $1 billion in debt, had 11% operating margins, and was still sold for only 9x next years earnings, so until that next year earnings becomes at least 15x the best thing to do is give a higher dividend yield and refinance the debt every few years at lower interest rates, seems like the government does not want higher rates for a while.
5.      I assumed a 21% tax rate, but given Biden administration can go to 30% so that can hurt the numbers a bit.
6.      I assumed worst case scenario was 3x P/E and best case is 11x P/E over a 10 year period.  Here is what I get:
a.      2021 is $6.80 to $25
b.      2022 is $8.50 to $31
c.       2023 is $10 to $37
d.      2024 is $12 to $43
e.      2025 is $14 to $49
f.        2031…yea I skipped a few years…. is $21.50 to $80
g.      Keep in mind this does not include the dividends you collected every year either.
 
Conclusion
JOAN is selling for an insanely cheap multiple and the best part is you get a nice dividend of 13% a year if it keeps trading at a low multiple, I really don't see this trading at less than 3 times earnings for 2021 so the real downside risk is to $9/$10 and worst case you get paid to wait, better than the money you get a bank these days, right?

872,,ValueInvesting,"*Note to reader: This is a copy from my* [*blog*](https://brianlangis.wordpress.com/2021/04/21/lumen-technologies-an-old-school-value-investors-favorite/) *that I wanted to share. The notes are from my* [*Seeking Alpha*](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4419926-lumen-technology-old-school-value-investors-favorite) *article on Lumen Technologies.*

It's been a few months since my last write up on Seeking Alpha. Since October 2020 I think. You can read the full thing on [Seeking Alpha](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4419926-lumen-technology-old-school-value-investors-favorite). They hold the rights. Below are just quick notes and I suggest to read the full thing to get the proper picture of the company and opportunity.

Disclosure: I'm long Lumen Technologies ($[LUMN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LUMN)).

* I found out about Lumen Technologies through a Globe and Mail article discussing Francis Chou's Stonetrust investments. [Stonetrust Commercial](https://www.stonetrustinsurance.com/) is an insurance company in the U.S. and like most insurance companies they make money through disciplined underwriting and properly investing the float. It turned out that Lumen is a large holding. Who still has a landline? Why would Francis want to own a dying copper landline business? I had to look to deeper into this.
* It turns out that the stock is a favorite of some [other old school value investors](https://dataroma.com/m/stock.php?sym=LUMN) such as Dr. Michael Burry from Scion Asset Management, Prem Watsa from Fairfax Financials, and Mason Hawkins from Southeastern Asset Management. Something must attract them.
* Lumen Technologies has 1.1 billion shares that trades at $12.70 a share with a market cap of $13.9b. Lumen distributes a fat 7.9% dividend yield or $1 annually which indicates that the market is not too hot on the company. Lumen distributes a fat 7.9% dividend yield. It looks safe. It's covered by free cash flow of $2.8b-$3.0. That's enough to cover the $1.1b in annual dividend distribution. Management has reiterated their commitment. Of course that's never guarantee, but more a signal of confidence to the market.
* The market is currently valuing Lumen at 5x adjusted EV/EBITDA, 8.2x 2021E earnings, and 4.7x price to free cash flow per share of $2.74, my preferred metric. This implies a 21% FCF yield. When it comes to a company like Lumen, that has a lot of debt and D&amp;A, measuring the right amount of cash left should take precedence over earnings.
* The depressed valuation, a market revaluation of their core assets, an improved profitability profile and balance sheet, and potential growth is what probably attracted these value investors.
* Lumen Technologies, formerly CenturyLink, provides communications and network services as well as security, cloud solutions, voice and managed services. CenturyLink and Quantum Fiber for residential and small businesses. Lumen for enterprises.
* The firm owns 450,000 miles of fiber. It's one of the largest fiber optics network in the world. Most of it comes from their acquisition of Level 3 in 2017. It's a Tier-1 network. That's the network with the most connections. You need to pay for access. This is their competitive advantage. Lumen sells (wholesale) high bandwidth fiber optic long haul links to other carriers.
* Remember the old Internet as a “superhighway” analogy, well Lumen is one of the major highways. Lumen is among the largest network providers in the world. If their network fails, it takes jump a huge part of the Internet with them.
* Their massive fiber network and infrastructure acts as a moat. It’s too expensive to build and to develop it against the experts in the field. Fiber businesses are attractive because once it’s built, the “maintenance” or “sustaining” capex is relatively limited, and that drives FCF.
* The value of Lumen's fiber infrastructure network is not recognized by the market given the FCF yield of 21.5%. Lumen is looking to monetize their recently completed 3-year investment program and the 7.9% dividend yield looks safe. The downside is protected by the value of its fiber network (the cost to build a similar network is probably hundreds of billions) and recent large transactions for fiber peers were at double-digit EBITDA multiples.
* Lumen is the new name for CenturyLink since September 2020. The rebranding comes with a new business strategy that goes beyond just offering connection services. They recently launched the Lumen Platform to run cloud and edge computing applications. Lumen is betting that the platform will fuel growth.
* The Lumen Platform is a move beyond providing basic connectivity. It has the capabilities that go beyond providing just internet service. With the Lumen Platform, it will level its fiber infrastructure to provide software or other needs “as a service.” Practically, what we are seeing is the evolution from telecom company (CenturyLink) to tech company (Lumen).
* A lumen is a measure of the brightness of light and the name pays homage to their fast global fiber network foundation.
* It's a myth that 5G will not kill fiber. Instead it will enhance it's importance. 5G requires a lot more cell towers, a lot more bandwidth, and will need to be connected to a wired network. The explosion in data use, particularly mobile, could make fiber assets much more lucrative. 5G needs a fiber network that can power it through multiple contact points, and help it reconnect through physical barriers.
* Edge computing. Of all the new products Lumen is launching, the Lumen Edge Compute will be one of the main drivers of future growth. I think there’s a part of the cloud story that’s overlooked and that is edge computing. With the 5G rollout, edge computing is two words we will be hearing a lot more in the coming years. Edge computing places processing power closer to where data is being created in the physical world. Edge computing is a complement to the cloud by solving issues of latency, bandwidth, autonomy, or compliance.
* One great driver for edge computing is reduced latency (much faster computing speed means reduced waiting time). The more processing can do at the edge level, the less you have to rely on the cloud, and the faster the computing
* Lumen has a lot of debt and makes up most of the enterprise value of $45b. With debt there's what you owe and what you need to pay. They have been aggressive to pay down the debt over the years. Q4-2020 long-term debt stands at $31.8b. In 2020 alone Lumen managed to reduce net debt by approximately $1.6 billion and reduced leverage to 3.6x net-debt-to-adjusted.
* If I applied a price to sale multiple of 0.8x to 1x on depressed sales ($19b vs $20b actual), you are looking at a 9% to 36.4% gain. If Lumen manages to grow their sales, it will warrant a higher multiple.
* If we assume a 15% FCF yield (6.6x FCF), Lumen would return 34%. If Lumen manages to grow, it warrants a minimum multiple of 10x FCF, and this would imply a return of 115%.
* It won’t happen overnight. I don’t expect a significant short-term boom in revenues from their investments. This is a long term play. Instead I picture a slow rising trickle of revenue growth as the country upgrades the wireless network to support 5G standards.
* Three-pronged approach to higher stock price:

1. Market revaluation of fiber network and assets to more reasonable level. The cost and importance of building it should be the floor.
2. An improvement of the business. Growth + more profit + more FCF + less debt = higher stock price. Right now the market is not confident in Lumen. The mood is bad. Better results will change the mood.
3. Financial engineering. Selling off assets at higher than market prices to pay down the debt. Refinancing expensive debt at cheaper interest rate. Synergies from Level 3 acquisition. NOL that's in the bank etc...

* Ultimately, results will drive the stock price. Even with a conservative approach, I think there’s material upside if Lumen converts on the opportunities it sees and little downside if it misses. The negative is already priced in. Meanwhile you have an opportunity to buy a company with irreplaceable assets that's considered cheap on many different metrics.

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been a few months since my last write up on Seeking Alpha. Since October 2020 I think. You can read the full thing on &lt;a href=""https://seekingalpha.com/article/4419926-lumen-technology-old-school-value-investors-favorite""&gt;Seeking Alpha&lt;/a&gt;. They hold the rights. Below are just quick notes and I suggest to read the full thing to get the proper picture of the company and opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disclosure: I&amp;#39;m long Lumen Technologies ($&lt;a href=""https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LUMN""&gt;LUMN&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I found out about Lumen Technologies through a Globe and Mail article discussing Francis Chou&amp;#39;s Stonetrust investments. &lt;a href=""https://www.stonetrustinsurance.com/""&gt;Stonetrust Commercial&lt;/a&gt; is an insurance company in the U.S. and like most insurance companies they make money through disciplined underwriting and properly investing the float. It turned out that Lumen is a large holding. Who still has a landline? Why would Francis want to own a dying copper landline business? I had to look to deeper into this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It turns out that the stock is a favorite of some &lt;a href=""https://dataroma.com/m/stock.php?sym=LUMN""&gt;other old school value investors&lt;/a&gt; such as Dr. Michael Burry from Scion Asset Management, Prem Watsa from Fairfax Financials, and Mason Hawkins from Southeastern Asset Management. Something must attract them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lumen Technologies has 1.1 billion shares that trades at $12.70 a share with a market cap of $13.9b. Lumen distributes a fat 7.9% dividend yield or $1 annually which indicates that the market is not too hot on the company. Lumen distributes a fat 7.9% dividend yield. It looks safe. It&amp;#39;s covered by free cash flow of $2.8b-$3.0. That&amp;#39;s enough to cover the $1.1b in annual dividend distribution. Management has reiterated their commitment. Of course that&amp;#39;s never guarantee, but more a signal of confidence to the market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The market is currently valuing Lumen at 5x adjusted EV/EBITDA, 8.2x 2021E earnings, and 4.7x price to free cash flow per share of $2.74, my preferred metric. This implies a 21% FCF yield. When it comes to a company like Lumen, that has a lot of debt and D&amp;amp;A, measuring the right amount of cash left should take precedence over earnings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The depressed valuation, a market revaluation of their core assets, an improved profitability profile and balance sheet, and potential growth is what probably attracted these value investors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lumen Technologies, formerly CenturyLink, provides communications and network services as well as security, cloud solutions, voice and managed services. CenturyLink and Quantum Fiber for residential and small businesses. Lumen for enterprises.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The firm owns 450,000 miles of fiber. It&amp;#39;s one of the largest fiber optics network in the world. Most of it comes from their acquisition of Level 3 in 2017. It&amp;#39;s a Tier-1 network. That&amp;#39;s the network with the most connections. You need to pay for access. This is their competitive advantage. Lumen sells (wholesale) high bandwidth fiber optic long haul links to other carriers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember the old Internet as a “superhighway” analogy, well Lumen is one of the major highways. Lumen is among the largest network providers in the world. If their network fails, it takes jump a huge part of the Internet with them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Their massive fiber network and infrastructure acts as a moat. It’s too expensive to build and to develop it against the experts in the field. Fiber businesses are attractive because once it’s built, the “maintenance” or “sustaining” capex is relatively limited, and that drives FCF.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The value of Lumen&amp;#39;s fiber infrastructure network is not recognized by the market given the FCF yield of 21.5%. Lumen is looking to monetize their recently completed 3-year investment program and the 7.9% dividend yield looks safe. The downside is protected by the value of its fiber network (the cost to build a similar network is probably hundreds of billions) and recent large transactions for fiber peers were at double-digit EBITDA multiples.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lumen is the new name for CenturyLink since September 2020. The rebranding comes with a new business strategy that goes beyond just offering connection services. They recently launched the Lumen Platform to run cloud and edge computing applications. Lumen is betting that the platform will fuel growth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Lumen Platform is a move beyond providing basic connectivity. It has the capabilities that go beyond providing just internet service. With the Lumen Platform, it will level its fiber infrastructure to provide software or other needs “as a service.” Practically, what we are seeing is the evolution from telecom company (CenturyLink) to tech company (Lumen).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A lumen is a measure of the brightness of light and the name pays homage to their fast global fiber network foundation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#39;s a myth that 5G will not kill fiber. Instead it will enhance it&amp;#39;s importance. 5G requires a lot more cell towers, a lot more bandwidth, and will need to be connected to a wired network. The explosion in data use, particularly mobile, could make fiber assets much more lucrative. 5G needs a fiber network that can power it through multiple contact points, and help it reconnect through physical barriers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edge computing. Of all the new products Lumen is launching, the Lumen Edge Compute will be one of the main drivers of future growth. I think there’s a part of the cloud story that’s overlooked and that is edge computing. With the 5G rollout, edge computing is two words we will be hearing a lot more in the coming years. Edge computing places processing power closer to where data is being created in the physical world. Edge computing is a complement to the cloud by solving issues of latency, bandwidth, autonomy, or compliance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One great driver for edge computing is reduced latency (much faster computing speed means reduced waiting time). The more processing can do at the edge level, the less you have to rely on the cloud, and the faster the computing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lumen has a lot of debt and makes up most of the enterprise value of $45b. With debt there&amp;#39;s what you owe and what you need to pay. They have been aggressive to pay down the debt over the years. Q4-2020 long-term debt stands at $31.8b. In 2020 alone Lumen managed to reduce net debt by approximately $1.6 billion and reduced leverage to 3.6x net-debt-to-adjusted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I applied a price to sale multiple of 0.8x to 1x on depressed sales ($19b vs $20b actual), you are looking at a 9% to 36.4% gain. If Lumen manages to grow their sales, it will warrant a higher multiple.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we assume a 15% FCF yield (6.6x FCF), Lumen would return 34%. If Lumen manages to grow, it warrants a minimum multiple of 10x FCF, and this would imply a return of 115%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It won’t happen overnight. I don’t expect a significant short-term boom in revenues from their investments. This is a long term play. Instead I picture a slow rising trickle of revenue growth as the country upgrades the wireless network to support 5G standards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Three-pronged approach to higher stock price:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Market revaluation of fiber network and assets to more reasonable level. The cost and importance of building it should be the floor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An improvement of the business. Growth + more profit + more FCF + less debt = higher stock price. Right now the market is not confident in Lumen. The mood is bad. Better results will change the mood.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Financial engineering. Selling off assets at higher than market prices to pay down the debt. Refinancing expensive debt at cheaper interest rate. Synergies from Level 3 acquisition. NOL that&amp;#39;s in the bank etc...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ultimately, results will drive the stock price. Even with a conservative approach, I think there’s material upside if Lumen converts on the opportunities it sees and little downside if it misses. The negative is already priced in. Meanwhile you have an opportunity to buy a company with irreplaceable assets that&amp;#39;s considered cheap on many different metrics.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Position of recognition: Mohnish Pabrai (Pabrai Investment Funds, has obtained 25.7% in the last 18 years, although he does not manage a fund of billions like the rest)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t include Buffet on the list because he&amp;#39;s basically in his own league. It manages a portfolio of hundreds of billions that makes it impossible to have extraordinary returns, although it has obtained 10.3% since 2000. It is the best of all and the comparison with the rest is absurd.&lt;/p&gt;

Even profitable companies like SHOP and TSLA have PE ratios well over 1000!!

You'd think that Coinbase ($COIN), a profit machine, as well as being in one of the fastest growing industries, would have a ridiculous valuation.

Well I wanted to crunch some numbers and show you guys what the TRUE valuation for coinbase is. A few weeks ago, Coinbase published their first Q1 21 results. They generated about $765 million in profit, and $1.8 billion in revenue

First and foremost, very impressive, but if we multiply those numbers out and pretend they have similar earnings/revenue for the reminder of the year, then we are looking at a company that posts $3B in net income, and $7.2B in revenue

$765 million net income x 4 quarters = $3B in net income FY 2021

$1.8 billion revenue x 4 quarters = $7.2B in revenue FY 2021

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, it's impossible to say what coinbase full year results will look at but assuming this is somewhat correct, and we are looking at a company with about an $85B total market cap, then this company has a forward PE of 28 and a forward PS of 12

$85B Market Cap / $3B Projected Earnings = 28 PE

$85B Market Cap / $7.2 Projected Revenue = 12 PS

&amp;#x200B;

Compare that to many tech companies and, well, you're looking at a ridiculously undervalued stock.

That all being said, I think there are some fundamental problems with $COIN that not many people are talking about or even considering.

Genesis Healthcare, per their own website, describes themselves as, *"" As the nation's leading provider of healthcare services from short-term to long-term and a wide variety of living options and professional clinical services, Genesis focuses on the Vitality of the person.  How and where we can make a difference in the overall well-being and healthy outlook of everyone we serve is our daily mission.""* Their website can be found [**HERE**](https://www.genesishcc.com/)**.** 

Also directly from their website: *"" Genesis Healthcare, Inc. (OTC PINK: GENN) is a holding company with subsidiaries that, on a combined basis, comprise one of the nation's largest post-acute care providers with more than 325 skilled nursing centers and senior living communities in 24 states nationwide. Genesis subsidiaries also supply rehabilitation therapy to approximately 1,100 locations in 44 states and the District of Columbia. ""* A list of their locations can be found [**HERE**](https://www.genesishcc.com/findlocations/)**.**

In summation of why the stock is so low right now- They have been struggling with bad management and cash flow for a few years, but COVID was the final nail in the coffin, as the disease wreaked havoc on skilled nursing facilities, especially on the east coast and eastern Midwest. This culmination of factors has barely allowed them to avoid bankruptcy, and they have recently been given a multimillion-dollar cash injection 

**Strengths:**

* Their first and biggest strength to me is their recently appointed CEO- Harry Wilson. His Wikipedia page can be found [**HERE**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Wilson_(businessman)). He is a highly regarded ""turnaround specialist"". And while empty terms like these usually put me off, with him, it does appear to actually be the case. He was involved heavily in the government restructuring of GM, getting rid of bloat (and sadly, Pontiacs...) and has made GM a successful company in the wake of their financial troubles. An interview with him regarding GM can be found [**HERE**](https://www.cnbc.com/2015/03/10/its-not-the-same-old-gm-activist-harry-wilson.html). 
* Their infrastructure is already in place, with healthcare facilities dotted all over the US in 24 states. 
* Many of their locations are in already population-dense areas with increasingly aging populations.

**Weaknesses:**

* The company is a mess. If it wasn't, they wouldn't need to bring in the heavy hitters like Harry. 
* Several facilities are on leased land vs owned by Genesis. This could mean if the owner of the physical facility doesn't like what's going on with Genesis, they could pull the agreement. 
* Low trading volume on the OTC exchange. OTC listing can be found [**HERE**](https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/GENN/news)**.** 
* The company has flipped between private and public control for decades.

**Opportunities**

* The company price is trading at historic lows. While it is impossible to find the bottom, it sure as hell looks like it could be close.
* The company delisted itself off the NASDAQ. A turnaround specialist will likely prioritize getting back on it.
* The end of COVID is in sight, with obvious implications for places like skilled care facilities.
* With company infrastructure already in place, a quick turnaround is completely possible and likely with the new management changes.
* Getting relisted on the NASDAQ would bring increased volume and ""legitimacy"".
* Pivoting into new areas with a focus on rehabilitation and Physical therapy vs strictly long-term care could bring about new and sustainable revenue streams.
* Someone may end up just buying them out. This could end up being bad as well as good, but an opportunity nonetheless.

**Threats**

* The hole they've dug themselves may be too deep to climb out of. 
* Regulation- Elizabeth Warren has promised an investigation into a payment to their former CEO at the end of 2020. Link [HERE](https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/warren-releases-new-details-on-genesis-nursing-home-companys-massive-ceo-payout). 

My take on this company is very simple. I don't believe a guy like Harry Wilson would get involved if he didn't think there was a massive opportunity to turn the ship around. His appointment, coupled with a recent massive sell-off over the last few months leads me to believe this may end up being an excellent longer-term play, with the possibility of short-term news also driving gains. My largest catalyst I foresee is toward the end of 2020. If numbers look good, and positive change and turnaround are happening, it could bring about a massive price swing and put Genesis back on the map. I have a feeling Harry, being a hedge fund guy, will have being re-listed on the NASDAQ a priority as well. I am currently in for 2450 shares at a cost basis of $.257 ea.

&lt;li&gt;Low trading volume on the OTC exchange. OTC listing can be found &lt;a href=""https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/GENN/news""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HERE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The company has flipped between private and public control for decades.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opportunities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The company price is trading at historic lows. While it is impossible to find the bottom, it sure as hell looks like it could be close.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The company delisted itself off the NASDAQ. A turnaround specialist will likely prioritize getting back on it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The end of COVID is in sight, with obvious implications for places like skilled care facilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With company infrastructure already in place, a quick turnaround is completely possible and likely with the new management changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting relisted on the NASDAQ would bring increased volume and &amp;quot;legitimacy&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pivoting into new areas with a focus on rehabilitation and Physical therapy vs strictly long-term care could bring about new and sustainable revenue streams.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Someone may end up just buying them out. This could end up being bad as well as good, but an opportunity nonetheless.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Threats&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The hole they&amp;#39;ve dug themselves may be too deep to climb out of. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regulation- Elizabeth Warren has promised an investigation into a payment to their former CEO at the end of 2020. Link &lt;a href=""https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/warren-releases-new-details-on-genesis-nursing-home-companys-massive-ceo-payout""&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My take on this company is very simple. I don&amp;#39;t believe a guy like Harry Wilson would get involved if he didn&amp;#39;t think there was a massive opportunity to turn the ship around. His appointment, coupled with a recent massive sell-off over the last few months leads me to believe this may end up being an excellent longer-term play, with the possibility of short-term news also driving gains. My largest catalyst I foresee is toward the end of 2020. If numbers look good, and positive change and turnaround are happening, it could bring about a massive price swing and put Genesis back on the map. I have a feeling Harry, being a hedge fund guy, will have being re-listed on the NASDAQ a priority as well. I am currently in for 2450 shares at a cost basis of $.257 ea. Thank you for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

913,,ValueInvesting,"Hi, recently I've reading lots of post regarding intrisic value and DCF valuation method and I think it would be useful for some of us that partially understood the logics behind them to understand them better.

Firstly I will explain the valuation method of Phil town: Basically what he does to get the Future Price is taking the TTM EPS (Diluted) and compound them lets say 10 years at a rate g and multiply it by a future  appropiate PE ratio (sometimes called Terminal PE). Future Price = TTM EPS * (1+g)^10 * future PE. To get the intrisic value of the stock then, he simply calculates the present value of the the Future Price using a diacount rate d. Intrinsic value = Future Price / (1+d)^10.

Regarding the DFC valuation method, people generally use free cash flow (FCF). In DCF, the future cashflows are the following:
 Future Cash flows =compunded free cash flows at the projection/forecasting interval + terminal value of the stock. Generally:
-sum projected FCF = FCF(1+g)+FCF(1+g)^2 +FCF(1+g)^3 + ... + FCF(1+g)^10
-the terminal value I've seen calculated in different manners: the first is calculating the terminal value using a perpetuity formula and the second way is using an appropiate terminal multiple of the FCF: P/FCF * FCF(1+g)^10
 Finally to get the Intrisic value you apply the present value to the projected sum of FCF and to the Terminal value and you sum them.
Intrinsic Value = PV(Projected sum of FCF) + PV(terminal value)

Until now, ive just exposed my background in the valuation topic, so here is my issue: Why does the Phil Town valuation method considers the intrinsic value of the stock simply the terminal value part discounted and in contrast, it does NOT add the stream of cash flows (in his approach EPS): EPS (1+g) + EPS(1+g)^2+...+ EPS(1+g) from period 1 to 9, compared to the DCF where both intervals, 1 to 9 forecasted periods and the terminal value are part of intrinsic value formula? 
Basically, why (not exact formulas simy toake clear my question)
-phil town Intr. Value = terminal value
-DCF Intr. Value = terminal value + projected cash flows

Is due to the fact one uses EPS and the other FCF or is because Phil Town just simplified the topic ??

914,,ValueInvesting,"Hey guys. I know this sub is for value investing. Just posting this here in case anybody can steer me in the right direction. 

Out of all the posters in WSB, it seems like there are some people with some legitimate backgrounds in finance and the valuation skills that come with it. So far, I’ve identified three:

1. u/deepfuckingvalue — was a CFA. Very fluid approach to investing. Is a self proclaimed deep value investor, but also includes technical analysis when forming a thesis on a company. 

2. u/player896 (OP of “Bankrupting institutional investors for dummies”) — made a post about passing first CFA exam, so I assume he’s becoming a CFA.

3. u/jeffamazon — no idea what background this guy has, but his analysis is legit. Any chance anybody know more about this guy?

Ok so now I have a few questions. 

1. Are there any other redditors posting great analysis worth following? If so, which ones? 

2. Is becoming a CFA absolutely necessary to learn how to do the analysis that DFV does?

3. Would it be possible to formulate the CFA curriculum myself without going to through the schooling/tests? Not for the sake of being a CFA, but just to know what a CFA knows (if it is in fact the case that CFA education is what gave DFV the skills to do what he does).

The  past couple of days I have been working on an intrinsic value  calculation spreadsheet and I am looking for feedback. I kept the  spreadsheet simple and tried to use as little variables as possible  because as you might know the more variables and estimations you need to  make the higher the chance getting one wrong which might corrupt the  outcome of the calculation.

For  everyone that wants to take a look at the spreadsheet. I will put a google drive link down below which contains the two files which you can view online (so no downloading required this time). One empty template  and a filled in example. The spreadsheet calculates the intrinsic value  using the free cash flow to equity of a business.

926,,ValueInvesting,"By a few, I mean a lot, but I'll try and condense down to the ones I'm working on now. If you do decide to chime in you'll have to hang in there with me. Finance is not my full-time job and I've got the IQ of a small monkey, so apologies in advance if I appear stupid. I am, but I'm trying because I genuinely love the subject matter. So with that out of the way, here's what I've got for questions.

**1) Is (EBITDA - CapEx) a decent proxy for the true underlying earnings power (free cash flow) of a business?**

My understanding of EBITDA is that it provides a less cloudy picture of a company's steady-state earnings because it doesn't include things like acquisition costs and/or other one-time items. I've also been viewing it as the cash flow a company can tap to pay down debt. I'm unsure if this is a valid view on EBITDA, but it seems to make sense to me. What I don't understand is why people neglect to subtract capital expenditures from EBITDA when using EBITDA as a proxy for cash flow. To me, CapEx looks like a recurring annual cost of doing business and should not be lumped into the same category as one-time costs and therefore should be subtracted from EBITDA if EBITDA is going to be used as a proxy for cash flow. Why is this view generally frowned upon or not considered?

**2) What are some decent metrics for measuring short-term and long-term solvency?**

I've been thinking about this one for a while now, and maybe solvency is the wrong word, but these are all I've been able to come up with - feel free to explain why they suck or how they can be made better:

Short-Term Solvency Metrics:

(Current Assets / Current Liabilities);

(Current Liabilities / (Current Assets + EBITDA - CapEx));

(Current Liabilities / (Current Assets + ((EBITDA - CapEx) / 2)));

Long-Term Solvency Metrics:

(Tangible Total Assets / Total Liabilities)

(Tangible Total Assets + ((5-Year Average EBITDA - CapEx) / 2) x 3 Years)) / Total Liabilites; 3 Years can be replaced with the time frame to nearest debt maturity.

((Current Liabilites + Long-term Debt) / (Current Assets + EBITDA - CapEx));

**3) Should I be using Enterprise Value in place of Market Capitalization when valuing businesses?**

As a shareholder, I feel the value relevant to me would be market capitalization since I'm not going to buy the entire business. However, enterprise value does seem like a truer proxy for value when compared to market capitalization as it takes into consideration debt and preferred. If a buyout were to occur, the acquirer would look at enterprise value, not market capitalization assuming my understanding of the two different values is correct. Does that mean I should switch my definition of market value from Market Capitalization to Enterprise Value? Does enterprise value even concern me since my focus is on the equity side?

**4) Is Research and Development a capital expenditure and if so, is it included on the cash flow statement under the line ""Purchase of Property, Plant and Equipment"" (aka Capital Expenditures)?**

From what I've read, R&amp;D appears to be an expenditure in that the lack of investment in that area leads to deteriorating future performance. R&amp;D, from what I understand, is essentially what drives future sales growth assuming it's done right.  Meaning it's a slightly variable never-ending recurring cost of doing business sort of like CapEx. ""Unavoidable recurring cost of doing business.""

**5) Is Cash Flow From Operations - Capital Expenditures a good enough proxy for Free Cash Flow when developing Discounted Cash Flow Models?**

I understand there are multiple proxies for cash flow, but the one above seems to be the quickest to calculate when filtering through large amounts of companies and even appears similar to Buffett's Owner's Earning's figure. If it's good enough for that guy, it should be good enough for this monkey right? So, is this figure reliable and can I use this figure consistently when developing discounted cash flow models or should adjustments be made? I've been looking into Free Cash Flow to Equity lately and that, in some ways, looks like a better metric since it takes into consideration all flows that can be used to pay out dividends. I don't believe CFO - CapEx (FCF) includes proceeds from the issuance of debt which in theory could be used to pay a dividend? If I read my sources right, that debt could technically be used to pay out dividends so it should be considered a cash inflow and should be added into your model's cash flow figure. I need to read up on the topic some more, but if anyone has a definitive answer I'd love to hear it. Just to be clear, here's what I might consider Free Cash Flow to Equity to look like: FCFE = Cash From Operation - Capital Expenditure + (Proceeds From the Issuance of Debt - Payments of Debt)

**6) Banks... CFO - CapEx doesn't seem reliable in that industry. Does that mean I need to make Net Income my proxy for Cash Flow?**

I've slowly come to understand that a banks asset values are marked to market each year meaning that book value is actually a decent representation of asset value, but I can't seem to wrap my head around the correct proxy for free cash flow. It appears to be something like this: Net Income - Growth Capital + Other Income. I definitely need to spend more time digging into this, but any leads on the topic would be greatly appreciated.

**7) Real Estate Companies... Net Operating Income, Funds From Operations, Free Cash Flow, Owner's Earnings, Net Income. Which one of these should I be using if I want to expand my horizon and start looking at these types of companies?**

It seems like it's dependent on the people in charge of the company. I really don't like that answer because that leaves room to inflate numbers. There has to be one metric that's the best. My thought is, its free cash flow (CFO-CapEx) like any other capital-intensive business. You have a house, you bought the house with debt, you rent the house out, there's a cash flow left over after payments on debt, taxes and maintenance and utility costs. Free Cash Flow right? Hopefully, that's not too simple of an example. It does get my mindset across though.

That's all I've got for now. I mean I've definitely got more, but I won't bore you any further. I truly appreciate any response to the questions above and I know this is Reddit, so I apologize for the long-winded post and I apologize if you come across spots in the reading that seem incoherent. This monkey is simply looking for some new tools he can craft to make life easier so I hope you can forgive me.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Is (EBITDA - CapEx) a decent proxy for the true underlying earnings power (free cash flow) of a business?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My understanding of EBITDA is that it provides a less cloudy picture of a company&amp;#39;s steady-state earnings because it doesn&amp;#39;t include things like acquisition costs and/or other one-time items. I&amp;#39;ve also been viewing it as the cash flow a company can tap to pay down debt. I&amp;#39;m unsure if this is a valid view on EBITDA, but it seems to make sense to me. What I don&amp;#39;t understand is why people neglect to subtract capital expenditures from EBITDA when using EBITDA as a proxy for cash flow. To me, CapEx looks like a recurring annual cost of doing business and should not be lumped into the same category as one-time costs and therefore should be subtracted from EBITDA if EBITDA is going to be used as a proxy for cash flow. Why is this view generally frowned upon or not considered?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) What are some decent metrics for measuring short-term and long-term solvency?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about this one for a while now, and maybe solvency is the wrong word, but these are all I&amp;#39;ve been able to come up with - feel free to explain why they suck or how they can be made better:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Short-Term Solvency Metrics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Current Assets / Current Liabilities);&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Current Liabilities / (Current Assets + EBITDA - CapEx));&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Current Liabilities / (Current Assets + ((EBITDA - CapEx) / 2)));&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long-Term Solvency Metrics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Tangible Total Assets / Total Liabilities)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Tangible Total Assets + ((5-Year Average EBITDA - CapEx) / 2) x 3 Years)) / Total Liabilites; 3 Years can be replaced with the time frame to nearest debt maturity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;((Current Liabilites + Long-term Debt) / (Current Assets + EBITDA - CapEx));&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Should I be using Enterprise Value in place of Market Capitalization when valuing businesses?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a shareholder, I feel the value relevant to me would be market capitalization since I&amp;#39;m not going to buy the entire business. However, enterprise value does seem like a truer proxy for value when compared to market capitalization as it takes into consideration debt and preferred. If a buyout were to occur, the acquirer would look at enterprise value, not market capitalization assuming my understanding of the two different values is correct. Does that mean I should switch my definition of market value from Market Capitalization to Enterprise Value? Does enterprise value even concern me since my focus is on the equity side?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4) Is Research and Development a capital expenditure and if so, is it included on the cash flow statement under the line &amp;quot;Purchase of Property, Plant and Equipment&amp;quot; (aka Capital Expenditures)?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From what I&amp;#39;ve read, R&amp;amp;D appears to be an expenditure in that the lack of investment in that area leads to deteriorating future performance. R&amp;amp;D, from what I understand, is essentially what drives future sales growth assuming it&amp;#39;s done right.  Meaning it&amp;#39;s a slightly variable never-ending recurring cost of doing business sort of like CapEx. &amp;quot;Unavoidable recurring cost of doing business.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5) Is Cash Flow From Operations - Capital Expenditures a good enough proxy for Free Cash Flow when developing Discounted Cash Flow Models?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand there are multiple proxies for cash flow, but the one above seems to be the quickest to calculate when filtering through large amounts of companies and even appears similar to Buffett&amp;#39;s Owner&amp;#39;s Earning&amp;#39;s figure. If it&amp;#39;s good enough for that guy, it should be good enough for this monkey right? So, is this figure reliable and can I use this figure consistently when developing discounted cash flow models or should adjustments be made? I&amp;#39;ve been looking into Free Cash Flow to Equity lately and that, in some ways, looks like a better metric since it takes into consideration all flows that can be used to pay out dividends. I don&amp;#39;t believe CFO - CapEx (FCF) includes proceeds from the issuance of debt which in theory could be used to pay a dividend? If I read my sources right, that debt could technically be used to pay out dividends so it should be considered a cash inflow and should be added into your model&amp;#39;s cash flow figure. I need to read up on the topic some more, but if anyone has a definitive answer I&amp;#39;d love to hear it. Just to be clear, here&amp;#39;s what I might consider Free Cash Flow to Equity to look like: FCFE = Cash From Operation - Capital Expenditure + (Proceeds From the Issuance of Debt - Payments of Debt)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6) Banks... CFO - CapEx doesn&amp;#39;t seem reliable in that industry. Does that mean I need to make Net Income my proxy for Cash Flow?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve slowly come to understand that a banks asset values are marked to market each year meaning that book value is actually a decent representation of asset value, but I can&amp;#39;t seem to wrap my head around the correct proxy for free cash flow. It appears to be something like this: Net Income - Growth Capital + Other Income. I definitely need to spend more time digging into this, but any leads on the topic would be greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7) Real Estate Companies... Net Operating Income, Funds From Operations, Free Cash Flow, Owner&amp;#39;s Earnings, Net Income. Which one of these should I be using if I want to expand my horizon and start looking at these types of companies?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems like it&amp;#39;s dependent on the people in charge of the company. I really don&amp;#39;t like that answer because that leaves room to inflate numbers. There has to be one metric that&amp;#39;s the best. My thought is, its free cash flow (CFO-CapEx) like any other capital-intensive business. You have a house, you bought the house with debt, you rent the house out, there&amp;#39;s a cash flow left over after payments on debt, taxes and maintenance and utility costs. Free Cash Flow right? Hopefully, that&amp;#39;s not too simple of an example. It does get my mindset across though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s all I&amp;#39;ve got for now. I mean I&amp;#39;ve definitely got more, but I won&amp;#39;t bore you any further. I truly appreciate any response to the questions above and I know this is Reddit, so I apologize for the long-winded post and I apologize if you come across spots in the reading that seem incoherent. This monkey is simply looking for some new tools he can craft to make life easier so I hope you can forgive me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope everyone&amp;#39;s doing well and I wish ya&amp;#39;ll the best.&lt;/p&gt;

i have read the Security Analysis book from Benjamin Graham.
Hard to read completely, but worth it.

Now im trying to calculate the Liquidation Value for an company. Grahams example is on site 561, here to see:
[Example calculating Liquidation Value](https://i.ibb.co/xM2SgRS/Calculating-Liquidation-Value.png
)

But Graham just subtract the short term debt. Why does he only subtract the short term debt and not the overall liabilities?

E.g. Apple has just $16B in short term liabilities and all liabilities together are $248B.

So which one would be correct? My understand is, that if i liquidate a company, i sell all his assets and then pay off all debt. The remaining cash will go to the stockholders. And in case of Apple, the shareholders would get nothing, because the remaining cash would be around $-80B.

So why does Graham used only the short term debt for calculating the liquidation value?

**BACKGROUND**

Patriot Gold Corp. (stock symbol: $PGOL) is a gold and silver company with a focus on Nevada and Arizona. The Moss Mine project, in which they own a 3% royalty is in commercial production. The Bruner gold project, in which they own a 2% royalty has delivered outstanding drill results and had a preliminary economic assessment carried out. Their wholly-owned Windy Peak, Rainbow Mountain and Vernal gold projects are all early stage.

The companies common stock trades on the CSE and OTC markets under the symbol $PGOL.

The price at the time of writing (15/04) is $0.1292 per share.

This stock has been on the OTCQB market since 2014; To be eligible for OTCQB, companies must be current in their financial reporting, undergo an annual verification and management certification process, and have a bid price of at least $0.01. They also cannot be in bankruptcy.

**HOW IT MADE IT ON TO MY WATCHLIST**

$PGOL just posted their late 10-K: [https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001080448/000168316821001392/patriotgold\_10k-123120.htm](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001080448/000168316821001392/patriotgold_10k-123120.htm)

**FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE**

In 2004, the company obtained a 100% interest in a number of patented and unpatented mining claims known as the Moss Mine property and in 2016 mining claims were sold to Golden Vertex Corp for $1.16M plus a 3% net smelter return (NPR) royalty.

During 2020 and 2019, they had revenues of $2.47M and $1.31M respectively, resulting from the aforementioned Moss royalty (88% increase).

Net income for 2020 was $2.03M compared to net income of $240K for 2019, for an approximate $1.79M increase in net income (8.45x increase). The increase in the net income is primarily due to the $1.16M increase of royalty revenue received from the Moss Mine (4.83x increase), as a result of the Moss Mine’s increase in gold/silver production. In addition, due to a change in the deferred income tax valuation allowance, the company recognised an income tax benefit of $1.16M.

**A SIMPLE EBIT VALUATION**

Example EBIT multiples for mining gold ores in 2021 are x13.23:

[https://www.eval.tech/valuation-multiples-by-industry/2021/Mining-Feb21.pdf](https://www.eval.tech/valuation-multiples-by-industry/2021/Mining-Feb21.pdf)

Patriot are showing an EBIT of $862K

$862K x 13.23 = $11.4M valuation.

However, they are also showing $3.69M on their consolidated balance sheet, including $1.12M as cash.

$11.4M + $3.69M = $15.09M.

The number of common stock shares issued and outstanding as of 2021 was 74,380,354 shares.

$15,099,978.39 / 74,380,354 shares = $0.20 per share (fair value), giving a 36% margin of safety.

**WHAT REASONS DO WE HAVE TO BE BULLISH BEYOND $0.20 PER SHARE?**

* Due to the commencement of the royalties from the Moss mine, management estimates that the Company will not require additional funding for the Company’s planned operations for the next twelve months.
* The Moss Mine is showing gold recoveries of 82% with silver recoveries of 65% (2015 feasibility study) and 2017 PEA outlined a 10-year mine life, $133 NPV and a 63% IRR (before taxes).
* The crushing throughput is consistently exceeding the 2015 feasibility study of 5,000 tonnes per day (tpd).
* Moss mine resource estimate as at December 2019:
   * Measured - 2.27 tons. 53K gold ozs. 575K silver ozs.
   * Indicated - 18.29 tons. 307K gold ozs. 3.88M silver ozs.
   * Inferred - 11.96 tons. 129K gold ozs. 1.38M silver ozs.
* Gold prices are expected to rise by the end of the year: [https://goldsilver.com/blog/gold-price-forecast-predictions/](https://goldsilver.com/blog/gold-price-forecast-predictions/);  Goldman Sachs sees gold rising back above $2,000 per ounce in 2021, with a potential to hit a new record of $2,300 based on current conditions. In 2020, one troy ounce of gold had an annual average price of $1,769.
* In addition to the Moss Mine resource, $PGOL have three great properties (4517 acres and approx. 320 claims); drilling has commenced on some of these properties and we are awaiting results:
   * [http://www.patriotgoldcorp.com/news/?id=119&amp;title=Drilling-Commencing-at-Patriot-Golds-Windy-Peak-Gold-Project-in-Nevada&amp;t=0](http://www.patriotgoldcorp.com/news/?id=119&amp;title=Drilling-Commencing-at-Patriot-Golds-Windy-Peak-Gold-Project-in-Nevada&amp;t=0)
   * [http://www.patriotgoldcorp.com/news/?id=118&amp;title=Drilling-to-Commence-at-Patriot-Golds-Rainbow-Mountain-Gold-Project-in-Nevada&amp;t=0](http://www.patriotgoldcorp.com/news/?id=118&amp;title=Drilling-to-Commence-at-Patriot-Golds-Rainbow-Mountain-Gold-Project-in-Nevada&amp;t=0)
* They also have agreed royalties interests for gold/silver (2% NPR on Bruner with Canamex) and vanadium (25 grams of Vanadium per barrel of bitumen produced).
* Canamex is planning to move the Bruner project forward into permitting and development using the proceeds from a gold stream forward sale to MetalStream Ltd; [https://www.stockwatch.com/News/Item?bid=Z-C:CSQ-3018883&amp;symbol=CSQ&amp;region=C](https://www.stockwatch.com/News/Item?bid=Z-C:CSQ-3018883&amp;symbol=CSQ&amp;region=C)
* Shareholders haven't been diluted in the last year.

**WHAT REASONS DO WE HAVE TO BE BEARISH ON PATRIOT GOLD CORP?**

* The 3% NPR royalties are recognised as revenue in the period that Golden Vertex produces and sells minerals from the Moss Mine, which began in March 2018. The royalties that have been received to date have been highly variable, as the amounts are dependent upon the monthly production, the demand of the buyers, the spot price of gold and silver, the costs associated with refining and transporting the product, etc.
* The company has a very small market cap - just $9.40M; this cuts both ways, but historic volatility is  421.787%.
* Average daily trading volume is only 89.3K; low liquidity can cause problems for smaller investors because it leads to a high bid-ask spread.
* There is no institutional ownership.
* Other valuation approaches are available; please let me know if there is a better approach, I considered EBITDA but wasn't sure I understood whether the income tax benefit would be available ongoing.
* As of 2020, there were 9.5M, 185K and 155K shares available for grant under the 2019 Plan, 2014 Plan and 2012 Stock Option Plan, respectively; so you might get diluted by up to 13% if things are going well. That said, there is some degree of safety with options valid for around 6.5 years and an average exercise price of $0.10.
* Multiples for Gold And Silver Ores (1040) are down over the last 4 years 16.99 --&gt; 13.23.

**WHAT ARE THE CATALYSTS FOR BUYING MORE?**

* They continue to benefit from increased production at Moss Mine for 3% NPR on the full 307K gold ozs and 3.88M silver ozs.
* They pick up additional 2% NPR on 391 gold ozs and 3.64M silver ozs at Bruner; or Canamax buy them out at the agreed $5M (adding $0.07 fair valuation to the sp = $0.27).
* The gold price rises inline with Goldman Sachs predictions providing a further 1.3x fair value multiplier to the sp = $0.35.
* Positive drilling results at Windy Peak and Rainbow Mountain gold projects; great sentiment for this penny stock which already has a year range of $0.028 - $0.23.
* Further licensing opportunities resulting from the positive drilling results (value TBC, but given the number of claims adding the same again isn't out of the question).
* Multiples for Gold and Silver Ores returns to previous levels e.g. [https://www.eval.tech/valuation-multiples-by-industry/2017/Mining-Aug17.pdf](https://www.eval.tech/valuation-multiples-by-industry/2017/Mining-Aug17.pdf) is showing a multiplier of 16.99.

&lt;p&gt;$PGOL just posted their late 10-K: &lt;a href=""https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001080448/000168316821001392/patriotgold_10k-123120.htm""&gt;https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001080448/000168316821001392/patriotgold_10k-123120.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2004, the company obtained a 100% interest in a number of patented and unpatented mining claims known as the Moss Mine property and in 2016 mining claims were sold to Golden Vertex Corp for $1.16M plus a 3% net smelter return (NPR) royalty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During 2020 and 2019, they had revenues of $2.47M and $1.31M respectively, resulting from the aforementioned Moss royalty (88% increase).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Net income for 2020 was $2.03M compared to net income of $240K for 2019, for an approximate $1.79M increase in net income (8.45x increase). The increase in the net income is primarily due to the $1.16M increase of royalty revenue received from the Moss Mine (4.83x increase), as a result of the Moss Mine’s increase in gold/silver production. In addition, due to a change in the deferred income tax valuation allowance, the company recognised an income tax benefit of $1.16M.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A SIMPLE EBIT VALUATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example EBIT multiples for mining gold ores in 2021 are x13.23:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.eval.tech/valuation-multiples-by-industry/2021/Mining-Feb21.pdf""&gt;https://www.eval.tech/valuation-multiples-by-industry/2021/Mining-Feb21.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patriot are showing an EBIT of $862K&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$862K x 13.23 = $11.4M valuation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, they are also showing $3.69M on their consolidated balance sheet, including $1.12M as cash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$11.4M + $3.69M = $15.09M.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of common stock shares issued and outstanding as of 2021 was 74,380,354 shares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$15,099,978.39 / 74,380,354 shares = $0.20 per share (fair value), giving a 36% margin of safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT REASONS DO WE HAVE TO BE BULLISH BEYOND $0.20 PER SHARE?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Due to the commencement of the royalties from the Moss mine, management estimates that the Company will not require additional funding for the Company’s planned operations for the next twelve months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Moss Mine is showing gold recoveries of 82% with silver recoveries of 65% (2015 feasibility study) and 2017 PEA outlined a 10-year mine life, $133 NPV and a 63% IRR (before taxes).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The crushing throughput is consistently exceeding the 2015 feasibility study of 5,000 tonnes per day (tpd).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moss mine resource estimate as at December 2019:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Measured - 2.27 tons. 53K gold ozs. 575K silver ozs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Indicated - 18.29 tons. 307K gold ozs. 3.88M silver ozs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inferred - 11.96 tons. 129K gold ozs. 1.38M silver ozs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gold prices are expected to rise by the end of the year: &lt;a href=""https://goldsilver.com/blog/gold-price-forecast-predictions/""&gt;https://goldsilver.com/blog/gold-price-forecast-predictions/&lt;/a&gt;;  Goldman Sachs sees gold rising back above $2,000 per ounce in 2021, with a potential to hit a new record of $2,300 based on current conditions. In 2020, one troy ounce of gold had an annual average price of $1,769.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In addition to the Moss Mine resource, $PGOL have three great properties (4517 acres and approx. 320 claims); drilling has commenced on some of these properties and we are awaiting results:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.patriotgoldcorp.com/news/?id=119&amp;amp;title=Drilling-Commencing-at-Patriot-Golds-Windy-Peak-Gold-Project-in-Nevada&amp;amp;t=0""&gt;http://www.patriotgoldcorp.com/news/?id=119&amp;amp;title=Drilling-Commencing-at-Patriot-Golds-Windy-Peak-Gold-Project-in-Nevada&amp;amp;t=0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.patriotgoldcorp.com/news/?id=118&amp;amp;title=Drilling-to-Commence-at-Patriot-Golds-Rainbow-Mountain-Gold-Project-in-Nevada&amp;amp;t=0""&gt;http://www.patriotgoldcorp.com/news/?id=118&amp;amp;title=Drilling-to-Commence-at-Patriot-Golds-Rainbow-Mountain-Gold-Project-in-Nevada&amp;amp;t=0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They also have agreed royalties interests for gold/silver (2% NPR on Bruner with Canamex) and vanadium (25 grams of Vanadium per barrel of bitumen produced).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Canamex is planning to move the Bruner project forward into permitting and development using the proceeds from a gold stream forward sale to MetalStream Ltd; &lt;a href=""https://www.stockwatch.com/News/Item?bid=Z-C:CSQ-3018883&amp;amp;symbol=CSQ&amp;amp;region=C""&gt;https://www.stockwatch.com/News/Item?bid=Z-C:CSQ-3018883&amp;amp;symbol=CSQ&amp;amp;region=C&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shareholders haven&amp;#39;t been diluted in the last year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT REASONS DO WE HAVE TO BE BEARISH ON PATRIOT GOLD CORP?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 3% NPR royalties are recognised as revenue in the period that Golden Vertex produces and sells minerals from the Moss Mine, which began in March 2018. The royalties that have been received to date have been highly variable, as the amounts are dependent upon the monthly production, the demand of the buyers, the spot price of gold and silver, the costs associated with refining and transporting the product, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The company has a very small market cap - just $9.40M; this cuts both ways, but historic volatility is  421.787%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Average daily trading volume is only 89.3K; low liquidity can cause problems for smaller investors because it leads to a high bid-ask spread.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no institutional ownership.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other valuation approaches are available; please let me know if there is a better approach, I considered EBITDA but wasn&amp;#39;t sure I understood whether the income tax benefit would be available ongoing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As of 2020, there were 9.5M, 185K and 155K shares available for grant under the 2019 Plan, 2014 Plan and 2012 Stock Option Plan, respectively; so you might get diluted by up to 13% if things are going well. That said, there is some degree of safety with options valid for around 6.5 years and an average exercise price of $0.10.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiples for Gold And Silver Ores (1040) are down over the last 4 years 16.99 --&amp;gt; 13.23.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT ARE THE CATALYSTS FOR BUYING MORE?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They continue to benefit from increased production at Moss Mine for 3% NPR on the full 307K gold ozs and 3.88M silver ozs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They pick up additional 2% NPR on 391 gold ozs and 3.64M silver ozs at Bruner; or Canamax buy them out at the agreed $5M (adding $0.07 fair valuation to the sp = $0.27).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The gold price rises inline with Goldman Sachs predictions providing a further 1.3x fair value multiplier to the sp = $0.35.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Positive drilling results at Windy Peak and Rainbow Mountain gold projects; great sentiment for this penny stock which already has a year range of $0.028 - $0.23.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Further licensing opportunities resulting from the positive drilling results (value TBC, but given the number of claims adding the same again isn&amp;#39;t out of the question).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiples for Gold and Silver Ores returns to previous levels e.g. &lt;a href=""https://www.eval.tech/valuation-multiples-by-industry/2017/Mining-Aug17.pdf""&gt;https://www.eval.tech/valuation-multiples-by-industry/2017/Mining-Aug17.pdf&lt;/a&gt; is showing a multiplier of 16.99.&lt;/li&gt;

# Bullish reasoning:

&amp;#x200B;

[I don't know any technical mumbo-jumbo, but here's the chart, earnings is in May or June](https://imgur.com/a/digYMew)

*You must see all the images to understand my DD, I don't know why reddit messed up my formatting*

Earnings will be beaten handsomely by STMP, as COVID hasn't really subsumed. Plus, the stock has a pretty big future considering the slow but sure shift to online sales.

[Good CEO ratings. Bad diversity ratings.](https://imgur.com/a/4cpLVTb)

# Bear points:

1. The moat is not necessarily the strongest, management has to continually deliver to keep on growing. I am fairly confident that they can do it. But you may not be.

2. Too conservative management. You can easily see this from their non-existent debt and huge cash position.

3. Too low volume. Float is also only 18M. Options bid-ask spread is wild.

[Options OI and volume](https://imgur.com/a/HXp7Omf)

4. It's kinda a deep value stock. There must be some reason which I am not seeing why it remains in this deep value territory. Private equity/activist fund sharks could target it, take it private and then DPO/IPO it  at 10 times the valuation; but being almost 90% owned by various institutions, reduces this risk.

5. 

[Mixed product reviews](https://imgur.com/a/uvNVGVz)

For reference,

&amp;#x200B;

[So, nothing can be definitively said about the stock seeing its product reviews because most of the time, only the frustrated customers would bother to review in TrustPilot](https://imgur.com/a/QpPymkH)

**Common question: Why did the stock drop so much in 2019 and stuff?**

Answer: They had an exclusivity deal with USPS where they got a lot of money for that deal. But management intentionally dropped it as USPS couldn't make 2 day delivery or the fast delivery requirements that is necessary to compete.

The market reacted very badly for this short-term bump in the road. But COVID-19 has proved that management was right all along and it was absolutely necessary to drop that deal to grow the company.

**Conclusion:** I think the stock will pretty reliably beat the upcoming earning and the stock will jump heavily before the earnings only to dump a little or a lot after the earnings. Basically, buy the rumour, sell... 
However, the stock is also a pretty decent one for long term holdings too.
Multiples are attractive keeping the growth in mind, and add to that the possibility of positive surprises from international expansion and probable acquisitions. If no acquisition occurs, the cash could get returned to shareholders through buybacks, which would be awesome too.

**TL;DR: STMP will at least reach $270+ before earnings come out. My crystal ball says so.

Hi all,

I've been (or atleast trying) to practice value investing for a while now.

I've read a lot books on the subject, but I have the feeling that most of them focus on what mentality or mindset one should have when practicing value investing.

What I'd like next is to truly know my way around the balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement - and be able to apply the most common valuation techniques.

I have a background in economics, so I'm familiar with most accounting terms. However, I've got the feeling that I tend to look at the balance sheet from an 'accounting' perspective rather than an 'investor' perspective. 

Not sure whether that makes sense, but I think what I'm trying to say is that I want to have a better understanding of how to interpret financial statements (and balance sheets) to determine investment decisions.

Any recommendations on what which books to read to advance my knowledge in this domain?

960,,ValueInvesting,"  

It's hard to find a multi-bagger stock in the days of high valuations. Especially when inflation has traditionally been linked to lower P/E in the stock market’s history. Three important features for a multi-bagger is a stock that has good growth potential, a low P/E, and good leadership. I believe that LL has all of those qualities. A few years back the company was entangled in two lawsuits. One involving formaldehyde at higher than acceptable levels and another for not sourcing their lumber in accordance with law. As a consequence, the cash flows were heavily decreased, and investor sentiment was massively damaged. Consequently, the current P/E is sitting at about 12. I will address in greater detail each of these three drivers now.

**Leadership:** 

Right after the legal entanglements, the CEO of the company was fired and  the company hired CEO Charles Tyson. Charles Tyson has worked with a lot of supply chains including Advance Autoparts, OfficMax, and Officedepot.  Since taking the position, he has focused on rebranding the company and increasing online sales and is trying to increase their market sales to pros.

**P/E:** 

Interestingly, although cash flows took a hit in 2019 and 2018 due to legal battles and therefore the earnings decreased, the revenue stayed consistent.  In 2019, their free cash flow was -20M and in 2020 it was 141M! I view their legal troubles as a chapter that has passed in the company’s history, but still has damaged their P/E as compared to their historical valuations. For example, FND, the closest market competitor, has a P/E of 57! 

**Growth:**

As everyone is aware, 2021 is going to be a blow out year for housing. Jerome Powell has repeatedly stated that interest rates will be kept low throughout the year, the Biden administration is looking for more infrastructure spending, and housing costs are all strong tailwinds for new housing starts. Moreover, one of the most common things people want done in a newly purchased home is the flooring redone. Lastly, hard flooring is expected to grow as carpeting shrinks as total market share. This company’s gross profit has grown for several years in a row, and it would be almost inconceivable that it won’t grow in 2021 and onward.

Additionally, LL has increased their digital presence with the release of a new app that allows people to virtually install flooring in their home by taking a picture of their current floors. I would recommend anyone to try the app out for free. It works incredibly well! I see these as great headwinds for growth of the company. 

I can’t help but feel incredibly confident in earnings of the company this year, even in the short term. Year over year earnings will be incredible. Q1 of 2020 was a terrible quarter. Historically they have always outperformed in Q1 vs the prior year’s Q4, but Q1 2020 was the shutdown quarter. As all indicators point to an incredible quarter, Q1 2021 will displace last year’s Q1 and dramatically shift the P/E even lower. Naturally, I see this as an even more enticing scenario as more people will want to buy the stock.  

For full disclosure, I love the stock, I own the stock, I will continue to invest in the stock, and I am not a financial advisor and you shouldn’t think I am providing financial advice.

2. **Road-trip travel demand is underestimated —** I've been hearing so much about pent up demand to travel by airlines, but what about the All-American family traveling by car/RV? For those that haven't done traveling over the past year, tires are a necessity.
3. **Employees return to offices —** As an employee that has WFH since last March, our employer is now expecting us to return to the office by end of summer. Once this happens, I personally will have to get my tires replaced. I expect millions of Americans to do the same.
4. **Inflation Hedge** — Returning to point #1, the inelasticity of demand will allow GT to pass price increases to the consumer instead of GT retaining these price increases.

986,,ValueInvesting,"First off, I want to say I am a moderate beginner when it comes to investing (and value investing in particular although this is where my ship has landed), and so please correct me where I have made mistakes. My goal is to provide a general idea which hopefully provides a high margin of safety to certain investments (high cash companies). Of course, I think the answer at the end of the day is that everything is priced in, but it is my understanding that value investors work with the belief that not everything is always priced in correctly. Also, from a theoretical side of options-- the driver of the price of options (besides strike and price of underlying) is the volatility of the stock. A theoretical (value based) price floor may not be cooked into the options prices, hence an opportunity could be offered to the value investor. Let me explain.

I want to try a  strategy where I purchase companies near zero or even below zero enterprise value by using covered calls, and I am wondering if anyone has insight to where paying for a bag of cash for cheaper than it is could turn out to be a bad idea.

The idea is that if a company has a high amount of cash, the covered call strategy can allow the investor to purchase the company near its enterprise value. For example, if a company is worth 1Bn and has 400M in cash (and no debt), and I can buy it at an effective valuation of 500M through covered calls, then the downside is very limited given the margin of safety the cash offers. Another way to see this is that long shares without CC means one is buying the company at 600M EV while the CC results in buying for 100M EV (6x the value!) Of course does this offer exist and would it not be priced in?

Here is why I think it might not be priced in:

\-Technical factors are driving the price of options more than the fundamentals of the underlying.

The idea being is market makers (usual option seller) are selling the option then hedging it based on volatility -- perhaps their automated algorithms won't know (or don't care) about a value based price floor of a stock. I don't want to get into my thinking too much here but that is the basic idea: the person / entity selling you the option doesn't know what you know-- it's just a good deal for them to hedge based on volatility. Of course you could argue that the market will know and more buyers than sellers etc, but I think that the options market may be more ineffecient with respect to fundamental value (especially for smaller companies) than it may seem. At least that's what I am hoping.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I am currently trying to find companies that meet the criteria. I haven't done too much work here, but scanning through finviz here is what I have found.

The companies with lowest P/C ratios tend to be banks and insurance companies. This makes sense since they are using that cash to generate returns, so this bag of cash while working for us is tied up in a lot of future liabilities. This made me turn to companies other than banks / insurers where the cash on hand seemed more like an added bonus rather than a necessary driver of returns. Here the fundamental value floor could be the cash on hand of the company (this hypothesis is where I am trying to figure out why and when this is wrong). Ideally, selling call options would hopefully let us get our cost basis of the stock below the floor (and still offer some upside, while eliminating a lot of downside).

Eliminating banks and insurance companies, it seems that the next type of company I am finding on this list of low P/C companies is the failing company. One that is going to burn through the money they have and generate negative returns to the investor-- one that you pay less for the bag of cash because they have proven that they can only lose money with such a bag. Obviously you would hope that such a company could just return the cash straight to the investors if the negative returns in the future were pretty much guaranteed, but I imagine this is not what actually happens. Hence buying at negative EV here isn't attractive because maybe the company is worth even less than the negative EV we obtain through covered calls.

Anyway, the goal would be to find a company that is at least as valuable as the bag of cash it sits on (not going to burn it through) and for which the covered calls allow us to buy in below cash value.

I wanted to apply this thought process to a company (not one I am particularly interested in buying, but one that could be used as an example). Doing some screening for companies that fit the criteria of low P/C, US company (less likely to be a scam), optionable (with an added bonus of decently high volatility) , I recently came across the example of a stock with the ticker AHC. It is a newspaper / media company and seems like it is sort of on it's last legs. Again, I'm not suggesting this to be a buy, but I feel like it represents a good example to bounce around to see if this strategy makes sense, or why this strategy fails.

The free cash flows aren't promising that this will generate good returns in the future ([https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AHC/ah-belo/price-fcf](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AHC/ah-belo/price-fcf)  \-- it has been oscillating between making a little money to losing a little money and most recently losing money), however it has a P/C ratio of 1.1, 0 debt, and paying 7% in dividends which indicates to me (a noob value investor) that they are trying to return the cash they have to the investor. Through the Nov CC, I could purchase shares effectively for a 0.8 P/C ratio, which means if the SP doesn't change would result in about a 37% return by the time the calls expire in Nov (and higher returns of course if it reaches the strike). From this perspective, this seems to offer great returns with the margin of safety of negative enterprise value. For instance, the SP would have to go fairly below the companies cash value for me to lose money on this trade. This seems like a great margin of safety with a high return! However, this of course is too good to be true. Any reason in this case why this isn't great value? I guess the things I'm thinking of where I could be going wrong are:

1. I am not understanding the true financials of the company.
2. A 25% off bag of cash + the EV of this company isn't worth it because they'll do something worse with the cash than would be the case if they just returned it to the investor.
3. Maybe they will return this bag of cash to the investor over time, but then we would have to discount it. Because we aren't getting the bag of cash immediately. Then again, this seems like a waste of a company to do such a thing, right?

Of course this company is just a test case of a more general idea which would be find similar companies (hopefully ones with more promising fundamentals) that I can take advantage of covered calls to buy below, at, or near 0 EV. Overall I am curious why might be buying a bag of cash for less than its worth be bad outside of the case of

1. The company is that awful that they'll be wasting the money they have anyway.
2. Banks / insurers.

I'm looking for some opinions/thoughts on the Royal Business Bank.  I believe the bank is potentially a good buy as it is currently trading below its book value despite being profitable and well capitalized (well capitalized via FDIC definition). It also places itself in a fairly unique market as it provides services primarily to Asian american communities. It also has a good book value growth rate and pays a decent dividend. The only two negatives I see are that it has somewhat limited trade volume and a somewhat low return on equity. Please see RBB's details below and let me know your thoughts.

According to their website, “BlueLinx is a leading wholesale distributor of building and industrial products in the United States with over 50,000 branded and private-label SKUs, and a broad distribution footprint servicing 40 states.

## Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

* FatStack Fair Price Estimate: **$62.01**
* Current Price: $43.13
* Current discount: 30.45%

## What I like about this company:

* The demand for [new homes](https://fortune.com/2021/03/20/lumber-prices-2021-chart-when-will-wood-shortage-end-price-of-lumber-go-down-home-sales-cost-update-march/) is at a 14-year high, and the lumber prices are at an all-time high, thanks to a lack of supply caused by a labor shortage during COVID. Both of these trends benefit Bluelinx.
* The two analysts that cover Bluelinx have an average valuation of $63.50, which interestingly is very similar to my estimate of $62.01.

## My concerns about this company:

* Lumber prices are at an all-time high, and demand for housing is sky high, so if the demand wanes for either or both of these over the next year, how will BlueLinx fare (and how will the stock price respond)? It’s a cyclical stock, and my hope is that housing and lumber stay strong over the next year.
* The debt-to-equity ratio is over 10, which is extremely high. I’m still figuring out how to think about these types of companies that have great numbers across the board, but have a lot of debt.
* BXC’s profitability numbers are low when compared to sector averages. This includes gross margin, operating margin, and free cash flow margin.

## The Wrap Up

I feel BlueLinx is undervalued, and primed to take advantage of the current housing boom. The company’s debt worries me, and there’s a chance lumber prices could fall, or that the housing market cools, but overall I like BlueLinx, and think the price still has room to run.

&lt;p&gt;Free Cash Flow Growth (YOY): 464%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EPS Growth (Q4 2020 vs. Q4 2019): 292%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Discounted Cash Flow Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FatStack Fair Price Estimate: &lt;strong&gt;$62.01&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Current Price: $43.13&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Current discount: 30.45%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What I like about this company:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The demand for &lt;a href=""https://fortune.com/2021/03/20/lumber-prices-2021-chart-when-will-wood-shortage-end-price-of-lumber-go-down-home-sales-cost-update-march/""&gt;new homes&lt;/a&gt; is at a 14-year high, and the lumber prices are at an all-time high, thanks to a lack of supply caused by a labor shortage during COVID. Both of these trends benefit Bluelinx.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The two analysts that cover Bluelinx have an average valuation of $63.50, which interestingly is very similar to my estimate of $62.01.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;My concerns about this company:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lumber prices are at an all-time high, and demand for housing is sky high, so if the demand wanes for either or both of these over the next year, how will BlueLinx fare (and how will the stock price respond)? It’s a cyclical stock, and my hope is that housing and lumber stay strong over the next year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The debt-to-equity ratio is over 10, which is extremely high. I’m still figuring out how to think about these types of companies that have great numbers across the board, but have a lot of debt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BXC’s profitability numbers are low when compared to sector averages. This includes gross margin, operating margin, and free cash flow margin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Wrap Up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel BlueLinx is undervalued, and primed to take advantage of the current housing boom. The company’s debt worries me, and there’s a chance lumber prices could fall, or that the housing market cools, but overall I like BlueLinx, and think the price still has room to run.&lt;/p&gt;

* KOF

* SBS

* CVS

I'm curious if anyone has encountered any of these listings during their own research.  If you are interested in dividend plays, I think KOF and PFE are especially interesting with annual dividend yields (as of today) greater than 4%.

Attached is a link to a screenshot of some of my research regarding intrinsic values (low and high) using different (mainly DCF) methods and projections.  It also lists the current price and distance the current price is (as a %) from both the low end intrinsic value and high end intrinsic value.

The fundamental goal of value investing is, quite simply, to buy a stock when it is low and sell when it is high. Seems easy, right? Though it may seem like common sense, the vast majority of investors do not do this. Very few use this strategy effectively. Some of the greatest investors of all time, such as Warren Buffett and Benjamin Graham, used a value approach in their investing careers.

After the positive feedback from my previous value investing interview I thought I'd share another interview I had with Value Stock Geek. I'm not sure if many of you are familiar with him (he might even be in this group) but he does some great write-ups on his blog [valuestockgeek.com](https://valuestockgeek.com) and currently published a book over on Medium called ""The Weird Portfolio"" I'd highly recommend reading it takes about an hour or two to get through. 

&amp;#x200B;

1024,,ValueInvesting,"Hi everyone. I'm trying to put together a python script to automate public companies valuations, as much as possible using free API data from here and there. Now I'm dealing with the enterprise value, most APIs we'll give you that metric which is nothing but:

Ev = Market Cap. + Total Debt - cash

But I want to calculate something more refined, since the whole idea is for me to improve and teak that number in the future (like the whole Damodaran method for example). In order to get to that, one would need the debt market value, and the easiest approach would be to take the entire debt as a single coupon bond,  with the coupon being equal to the interest expenses on all debt and the maturity as the weighted average maturity of the debt.  Now the thing is that I can't find where the liabilities repayment schedules are to be found. I get that this is a deeper kind of  data layer, so far as public low processed data go, but I haven't been able to find out that on the sec filings either.

To my surprise it seems to be a lot of info and insights regarding enterprise value, but almost nothing referring to the proper data sources from where you can build your own metrics, and I've done my fair share of research.

How would you do to get the average debt maturity?

Also, I'm just guessing, most people just take for granted the classic formula stated above when it comes to EV. But how do you guys deal with the proper EV for your valuations?

Now I&amp;#39;m dealing with the enterprise value, most APIs we&amp;#39;ll give you that metric which is nothing but:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ev = Market Cap. + Total Debt - cash&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I want to calculate something more refined, since the whole idea is for me to improve and teak that number in the future (like the whole Damodaran method for example). In order to get to that, one would need the debt market value, and the easiest approach would be to take the entire debt as a single coupon bond,  with the coupon being equal to the interest expenses on all debt and the maturity as the weighted average maturity of the debt.  Now the thing is that I can&amp;#39;t find where the liabilities repayment schedules are to be found. I get that this is a deeper kind of  data layer, so far as public low processed data go, but I haven&amp;#39;t been able to find out that on the sec filings either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my surprise it seems to be a lot of info and insights regarding enterprise value, but almost nothing referring to the proper data sources from where you can build your own metrics, and I&amp;#39;ve done my fair share of research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How would you do to get the average debt maturity?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I&amp;#39;m just guessing, most people just take for granted the classic formula stated above when it comes to EV. But how do you guys deal with the proper EV for your valuations? I&amp;#39;m curious to know what is the broad view.&lt;/p&gt;

_______________________________________________________________________________

Ok before I start. This will be a quite technical post but please bear with me.

Following the lectures of Prof. Damodaran, in a discounted cash flow analysis you usually discount future cash flows with the weighted averaged cost of capital (WACC). The WACC is given by

WACC = (Cost of equity x market value of equity + Cost of debt x market value of debt)/(market value of equity + market value of debt)

where the market value of equity is just the marketcap. Why do we use the marketvalues and not the book values? This question has a very simple answer. The market values are **what you actually pay.** However, this fact makes the concept of a DCF **instable.**

What do I mean by instable?   
**Let me evaluate**:

Let's assume you have a company with a debt/equity ratio (in market values of course) of 1 and find that  it's fair marketcap should be twice as large as it is now. Let's additonally assume  the estimate is right and the market corrects itself overnight. Now the  debt/equity ratio would suddenly drop to 1/2. This, however, would increase the  WACC and subsequently it would decrease the fair value estimate making  the company now look overvalued.

The problem arises from the fact that your DCF estimate of a fair marketcap depends on the actual marketcap. 

Let's run **some basic numbers**:

Assume you have a company with the following features:

1. Cash                                       = 10 billion
2. Market value of Debt          = 100 billion
3. Marketcap                            = 100 billion
4. Default Spread                     = 0.63% (AAA rating)
5. Free cash flow to the firm  = 10 billion
6. FCFF growth rate                 = 10% stable for 10years
7. riskfree rate                          = 1.5%
8. Cost of Debt                          = default spread + riskfree rate
9. Stable growth rate               = riskfree rate
10. Beta                                        = 1

no taxes and no country premiums or whatever (because there's already enough numbers up there...)

With an equity premium of 10% this gives a WACC of 6.8% and a discount rate of 7.4%. The Fair value would then be \~ 240 billion. 

Now let's assume it reaches these 240 billion in marketcap  overnight and no other numbers change. Evaluating the fair value again  would now result in a WACC of 8.7% which lowers the fair value estimate  down to only 119 billion.

Obviously you can  play this game over and over again until the fair value converges to a  fixed value. As I said before, the problem results from the fact that the WACC and  therefore the discount rate is a function of the marketcap.  


**Now what?**

A  solution to this problem would be to do exactly that i.e. find the  convergence limit. This means to numerically evaluate at which  marketvalue of equity X the DCF returns exactly this value X (I didn't  check but I think this equation is not analytically solvable so you have to run the convergence numerically). 

In the  above case that would be \~175 billion which is quite different from the  first estimate of 240 billion. Interestingly, this would introduce a  concept of a ""fair WACC"" additionally which would be the WACC at the convergence fair value.  


Should we all update our DCF models to include this?

This is my first post in the forum, and admittedly I'm not very good at fundamental analysis yet. But from what I do know so far, I can't see why this stock trades where it does. Most likely I'm dumb and missing something, but there's an outside chance I stumbled on an unloved gem.

This is Jo-Ann, a retailer specializing in fabrics and crafting supplies, somewhat similar to Michael's and Hobby Lobby. This is a recent IPO (March 2021) after being taken private back in 2011. The stock opened at $12.00, and is currently trading around there (range $10-14).

From a fundamental perspective, here are some of the things I (think I) know:

* Revenue for 39-weeks ending Oct. 31, 2020 were $1.9B (+24.3% Y/Y), however before COVID annual revenues were flat to low-single-digit decline at $2.2-2.3B.  

   * This trend holds up for FY2021 ending Jan. 31, 2021. $2.76B vs. $2.24B.
* Gross margins flat at 49.5% vs 49.3% last year.
* Operating profit at 5.6%. In 2019, there was a Goodwill impairment of $487MM (nothing in 2018/2020) - without which the OP was 2.2%. In 2018, OP was 6.4%.
* Net income was $212.3MM, 7.7% of revenue. (EBITDA was $323MM, 11.7%)  

   * This is $5.93 diluted EPS! 2 P/E! What in the world!? Granted, EPS is funky over last 2 years due to impairment in 2019. However, 2018 EPS was $1.00.
* Debt is pretty high. Market cap is \~$490MM but EV is $2.24B. Cash on hand is \~$27.4MM. They did pay down a net $284MM in debt in 2020, though.

Looking ahead to 2021-2022 (FY2022-2023 for Jo-Ann):

* Estimated $2.74 EPS in FY2022 and $2.77 EPS in FY2023 ($2.36 and $2.72 GAAP EPS) - Source Tikr
* Revenue normalizing post-COVID, FY2022 at -6.8% Y/Y to $2.57B (vs. $2.76B in FY2021, and $2.24B in FY2020). FY2023 +2.0% Y/Y to $2.63B.

Looking at analyst coverage, there's been a recent flurry of Buy/Overweight calls from top tier (Barclays, BofA, CS, WFC), with price targets ranging from $14-27. All of them are $14-17 except BofA at $27.

Not sure what I am missing. What do you guys see? Thanks in advance!

&lt;li&gt;In a hypothetical situation of a market-crash, will ITM options have liquidity?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If buying puts/selling calls, should I target a specific company stock, ETF sector, or ETF index? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: This is not financial advice, nor am I seeking financial advice. I am strictly asking to spur discussion and give me additional items to consider.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
